# Boba Lang Proposal

## 1. Executive Summary

Boba Lang is a modern, statically-typed, and interpreted programming language designed for professional developers seeking to eliminate the "ecosystem tax" of toolchain fragmentation. It directly addresses this industry-wide issue by providing a cohesive, "batteries-included" development experience with a familiar C-style syntax that integrates both imperative and functional programming paradigms.

A key innovation of Boba is its ergonomic design for a future of human/AI collaborative development. The language’s clean grammar and strong type-safety are engineered to be unambiguously parsed, analyzed, and generated by Large Language Models (LLMs), positioning the project at the forefront of AI-assisted software engineering.

To guarantee performance and memory safety, the core interpreter will be implemented in Rust. The project's primary deliverables are the boba interpreter, a comprehensive documentation website, and a VS Code extension powered by a custom Language Server Protocol (LSP) implementation. This unified toolchain, easily installed via common package managers, provides a seamless, powerful, and forward-looking development environment from day one, laying the foundation for a future native compiler.

## 2. Motivation and Learning Objectives

### Problem Statement

This project investigates two critical, interconnected problems at the intersection of language design, developer tooling, and the future of software engineering. The central thesis is that a new language, designed from first principles, can provide a unified solution to both.

1. The Developer Experience "Ecosystem Tax"

    The first problem is the persistent 'ecosystem tax' levied on developers by mainstream programming languages. This "tax" manifests as significant friction and cognitive overhead caused by toolchain fragmentation. Developers are routinely forced to research, configure, and maintain a disparate set of third-party tools for dependency management, code formatting, building, and static analysis. This ad-hoc approach leads to inconsistent project quality, slows down development velocity, and creates a significant barrier to entry. For professional developers and teams, this represents a direct and continuous drain on productivity and project resources.

2. The Emerging "AI-Ergonomics" Gap

    The second problem emerges from the rapid rise of AI-assisted development and the limitations of existing languages within this new paradigm. Most popular languages were designed exclusively for human programmers. Their often-complex grammars, syntactic ambiguities, and lack of built-in tooling standards create an "impedance mismatch" for Large Language Models (LLMs). This gap makes it difficult for AI tools to parse, analyze, and generate code with high fidelity and consistency. The result is unreliable code generation, subtle bugs, and a ceiling on the potential of true human-AI collaboration, a critical consideration for the future of the craft.

    The core investigation of this project is to design a single, cohesive system that holistically addresses both challenges.

### Relevance & Importance

The relevance of this project is twofold, addressing both a chronic inefficiency in today's software engineering practices and a critical emerging requirement for the future of the craft.

1. In Modern Software Engineering: A Case Study in Systems Thinking

    The "ecosystem tax" is not merely an inconvenience; it represents a significant drain on enterprise resources through wasted engineering hours, steep onboarding curves, and inconsistent code quality. This project challenges this status quo by treating Developer Experience (DX) as a first-class system design constraint. By architecting a vertically integrated language and toolchain, Boba serves as a practical application of modern Software Engineering & Systems Design principles. It aims to prove that a holistic focus on the developer's workflow can directly reduce cognitive load, improve development velocity, and lead to more maintainable software systems. This moves beyond theory and provides a tangible case study on the measurable benefits of a frictionless development environment.

2. For AI-Assisted Development: Proactive Design for a New Paradigm

    While many existing languages are being retroactively adapted for use with AI, Boba’s primary importance lies in its proactive design for the new paradigm of human-AI collaboration. The project's central hypothesis is that for an AI to be a reliable and effective partner, the language it interacts with must be fundamentally predictable and unambiguous.

    Boba’s design choices—a simple grammar, clear syntax, and strong static typing—are a direct response to the "AI-ergonomics gap." They are intended to minimize the potential for LLM "hallucinations" and produce more reliable, verifiable code. As such, this project is not just a language implementation; it is a timely and critical investigation into a foundational question for the next decade of software development: How do we design programming languages that are truly ergonomic for both human developers and their AI counterparts?

### Personal Learning Goals

This project is strategically designed to compel a master's-level synthesis of the core curriculum by building a single, complex system. My learning goals are mapped directly to the project's primary challenges: designing a novel language, engineering its professional-grade toolchain, and implementing it as a high-performance, cross-platform application.

1. Goal: Master Language Theory by Designing for Human and AI Ergonomics.

    **Theoretical Concepts**: I will apply and synthesize theories of language design by creating a statically-typed language from first principles. This involves not only mastering lexical analysis, parsing, and type systems but also specifically designing a clean, unambiguous grammar. The core challenge is to balance the needs of human readability with the requirements of reliable, high-fidelity parsing by AI models.

    **Curriculum Link**: This directly applies my theoretical studies in Programming Languages (Crafting Interpreters) and Compilers (Writing a Compiler in Go).

2. Goal: Master Modern Toolchain Engineering by Solving the "Ecosystem Tax".

    **Theoretical Concepts**: I will build a complete, user-centric toolchain to address the friction of fragmented ecosystems. This requires applying client-server architectural patterns to implement the Language Server Protocol (LSP), serving as a practical exercise in inter-process communication. The design of the CLI and its integration with the LSP will be a case study in creating a cohesive, vertically integrated product.

    **Curriculum Link**: This draws on architectural patterns from Distributed Systems (Designing Data-Intensive Applications) and the user-centric philosophy from Software Engineering & Systems Design (Software Engineering at Google).

3. Goal: Master High-Performance Systems Programming with Rust.

    **Theoretical Concepts**: I will gain deep proficiency in modern systems programming by implementing the Boba interpreter in Rust. This provides a practical, large-scale engagement with Rust's ownership and borrowing model—a paradigm for enforcing memory safety at compile time. Building a secure, cross-platform application will require grappling with operating system abstractions and applying defensive programming principles to create a robust runtime.

    **Curriculum Link**: This involves the practical application of concepts from Advanced Operating Systems (Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces) and, critically, internalizing the principles of memory-exploit prevention, a central theme in Computer Security (Hacking: The Art of Exploitation).

**Practical Skills Acquired**: Upon completion, this project will confer advanced proficiency in Rust for high-performance systems development; modern language and interpreter design; API and network protocol design (LSP); and the master's-level technical writing and research skills required to produce the final white paper and documentation.
