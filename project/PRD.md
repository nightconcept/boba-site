# Boba Lang Documentation Website - Product Requirements Document (Prototype)

1. Introduction

    Project Idea: To create a modern, professional documentation website for the Boba programming language. This site will be built using the Astro framework and its Starlight template. It will serve as the primary source of truth for human learners and as a persistent context provider for an AI development assistant.
    Problem/Need: Boba Lang needs a central, well-structured home for its documentation, tutorials, and language specification. This website addresses the need for clear, accessible materials and provides a crucial, stable context for AI-assisted development of the language itself.
    Prototype Goal: To establish the foundational structure of the Astro/Starlight site. This includes creating the main landing page, an initial "Getting Started" guide, and placeholder pages for key documentation sections like the formal grammar (EBNF) and a machine-readable llm.txt summary. The primary goal is to build a solid, well-styled scaffold that is ready for continuous content expansion.

2. Core Features / User Stories

    Feature 1: Informative Landing Page
        Description: A welcoming homepage that clearly explains what Boba Lang is, highlighting its simple syntax and developer experience. It should articulate the problems it aims to solve, such as overly complex syntax in other languages and the "developer ecosystem tax".
        User Action(s): User visits the root URL of the website.
        Outcome(s): The user quickly understands the core value proposition of Boba Lang and is presented with clear navigation to key sections like "Get Started" or "Language Concepts."

    Feature 2: "Get Started" Guide
        Description: A clear, step-by-step guide on how to install the Boba toolchain and run a simple program on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
        User Action(s): User navigates to the "Guides" > "Get Started" section.
        Outcome(s): A new user can successfully install the language and its tools on their local machine.

    Feature 3: Initial Language Concept Pages
        Description: Create the first few documentation pages detailing core language features based on the provided design. For the prototype, this will include dedicated pages for "Variables" and "Functions."
        User Action(s): User navigates through the "Language Reference" section in the sidebar.
        Outcome(s): The user can read clear explanations and see correct code examples for fundamental language constructs.

    Feature 4: Formal Grammar (EBNF) Page
        Description: A dedicated page to host the formal EBNF (Extended Backus-Naur Form) grammar for Boba Lang. For the prototype, this page will be created as a placeholder.
        User Action(s): User navigates to "Language Reference" > "Grammar".
        Outcome(s): A page exists at the correct URL, ready for the formal grammar content to be added later.

    Feature 5: Machine-Readable Context File (llm.txt)
        Description: Create a simple, non-rendered file within the project that contains a condensed, easily parsable summary of Boba Lang's syntax, types, and features. This file is specifically intended for an LLM to consume for context.
        User Action(s): An AI assistant or a developer accesses this file programmatically or manually to get a quick overview of the language.
        Outcome(s): A file is created (e.g., /public/llm.txt) containing the key language details from the initial info dump.

3. Technical Specifications

    Primary Language(s): Astro, TypeScript, Markdown (MDX)
    Key Frameworks/Libraries: Astro, Starlight (Astro template)
    Database (if any): None
    Key APIs/Integrations (if any): None for this prototype
    Deployment Target (if applicable for prototype): A static web host (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages)
    High-Level Architectural Approach: A static documentation website generated by the Astro framework. All content will be managed via Markdown (MDX) files, leveraging the built-in features of the Starlight template for layout, navigation, search, and styling.

8. Documentation Style Guide

The Boba documentation targets junior software engineers who want to get productive quickly. The style assumes familiarity with basic programming concepts while focusing on what makes Boba unique and practical. This approach respects the reader's existing knowledge while efficiently onboarding them to Boba's specific features.

### Voice and Tone Guidelines

**Overall Personality**: Experienced colleague showing you a better tool
- Confident and direct about Boba's advantages
- Assumes programming competence
- Focuses on practical benefits over theoretical explanations
- Gets you coding quickly without excessive hand-holding

**Target Audience**: Junior software engineers who:
- Have CS fundamentals from school or bootcamp
- Understand basic programming concepts (variables, functions, types)
- Want to learn Boba efficiently without lengthy explanations
- Prefer practical examples over detailed theory

### Writing Principles

#### 1. **Efficient but Clear**
- **Skip basic programming explanations**: Don't explain what variables or functions are
- **Focus on Boba specifics**: How Boba does things differently/better
- **Provide context for examples**: Brief explanation of what code demonstrates
- **Balance code and explanation**: Show syntax, then explain key concepts

#### 2. **Assume Competence with Guidance**
- **Assume technical ability**: Readers understand programming concepts
- **Provide practical context**: Explain why features matter, not just syntax
- **Use proper transitions**: Connect concepts and chapters smoothly
- **Include practice sections**: Reference exercises and hands-on learning

#### 3. **Practical Focus**
- **Lead with working examples**: Show complete, runnable code
- **Highlight practical benefits**: "This prevents runtime errors" vs "This is safer"
- **Include common patterns**: Show idiomatic Boba from the start
- **Connect to familiar concepts**: "Like TypeScript interfaces" or "Similar to Rust ownership"

#### 4. **Consistent Technical Language**
- **Immutable bindings**: Use "immutable" consistently, not "unchangeable"
- **Functions vs methods**: Precise distinction based on context
- **Error handling**: Use Result/Option terminology correctly
- **Type system**: Use proper type theory terms when relevant

### Formatting Standards

#### Code Examples
```boba
// Good: Clear, commented, realistic examples
fn calculate_score(base: int, bonus: int) -> int {
    return base + bonus
}

let player_score = calculate_score(base: 100, bonus: 50)
print(f"Your score: {player_score}")
```

#### Explanatory Text Structure
1. **Brief intro**: What you'll learn in 1-2 sentences
2. **Concept explanation**: The "what" and "why" 
3. **Code example**: Practical demonstration
4. **Key takeaway**: Reinforce the main point

#### Voice Examples

**✅ Good - Direct and Practical**:
> "Boba functions use named arguments for multi-parameter calls, preventing argument order bugs. Here's the syntax:"

**❌ Too Explanatory**:
> "Functions are essential building blocks that let you package up code for reuse, making your programs more organized and easier to maintain. Let's learn how to define your first function:"

**❌ Too Academic**:
> "Function definitions constitute a fundamental abstraction mechanism enabling code reuse through encapsulation of executable statements."

### Content Structure Guidelines

#### Chapter Organization
1. **Syntax first**: Show the code immediately
2. **Brief explanation**: What the code demonstrates and why it matters
3. **Key differences**: How this differs from other languages
4. **Practical examples**: Real-world usage patterns
5. **Practice section**: Reference to hands-on exercises ("Time to Practice")
6. **Smooth transition**: Connect to next chapter's concepts

#### Example Progression
- **Complete examples**: Show full, runnable programs
- **Idiomatic patterns**: Demonstrate best practices from the start
- **Realistic use cases**: Web servers, CLI tools, data processing
- **Performance considerations**: When relevant to junior engineers

#### Error Handling in Examples
- **Show compiler errors**: Include actual error messages
- **Demonstrate debugging**: Quick troubleshooting techniques
- **Common mistakes**: Patterns junior engineers typically encounter
- **Error recovery**: How to fix and move forward

### Specific Style Rules

#### Contractions and Informality
- **Use contractions moderately**: "You'll find", "we're going to", "it's important"
- **Avoid excessive contractions**: Not "should've", "would've", "could've"
- **Stay professional in technical sections**: Formal tone for reference material

#### Technical Precision
- **Be accurate about language behavior**: No hand-waving on important details
- **Use correct terminology**: Don't simplify at the cost of accuracy
- **Provide complete examples**: Code that actually compiles and runs
- **Include edge cases**: Address common beginner confusion
- **Mandatory explanatory text**: Every concept must have 1-2 paragraphs explaining what's happening before or alongside code examples
- **Junior engineer context**: Assume basic programming familiarity but explain Boba-specific behavior and design decisions without referencing other languages explicitly
- **Avoid language comparisons**: Don't assume knowledge of specific languages; explain features on their own merits

#### Encouragement Without Condescension  
- **Acknowledge difficulty**: "This concept can be tricky"
- **Provide reassurance**: "With practice, this becomes second nature"
- **Avoid diminutives**: Not "just", "simply", "obviously"
- **Respect reader intelligence**: Don't over-explain basic programming concepts
