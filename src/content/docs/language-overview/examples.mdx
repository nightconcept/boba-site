# Overview

This is meant to be a quick reference for Boba's syntax and features. 

## Assignment
```boba
let a = 1 // Inferred as type int
var b = 2.0 // Inferred as type float

let c: float = 3 // Explicitly assigned as a float

let name: string = "Boba"
var greeting = "Hello, " + name // Inferred as string
```

## If-else statement

```boba
fn if_example(a: int) {
  if (condition) {
    // do something
  } else if (condition2) {
    // do something else
  } else {
    // do something really different
  }
}
```

## For loop

```boba
fn for_example() {
  for i in 0..5 {
    print(f"This is loop number {i}")
  }
}
```

## For in loop
```boba
fn for_in_example() {
  let ingredients: List<string> = ["healing potion", "sword", "shield"]

  // The `for...in` loop will go through each item in the list.
  for item in ingredients {
    print(f"Player inventory contains: {item}")
  }
}
```

## While loop
```boba
fn while_example() {
  var countdown = 3

  while countdown > 0 {
    print(f"{countdown}...")
    countdown = countdown - 1
  }
}
```

## Enum and Match
```boba
fn enum_example() {
  enum Color {
    Red,
    Green,
    Blue,
  }

  match color {
    Color.Red => print("Red"),
    Color.Green => print("Green"), 
    Color.Blue => print("Blue"),
  }
}
```

## Structs

```boba

}

var player = Player {
  pub name: "Boba",
  health: 100,
}

player.name = "Best Player"
```
