## Project Mode

This mode is active when you run `boba` commands like `build`, `run`, or `test` without a file path.

-   **Invocation:** `boba build`, `boba run`, `boba test`

-   **Behavior:** The `boba` tool will look in the current directory (and parent directories) for a `boba.toml` file.
    -   If it finds one, it considers that directory the project root.
    -   All operations are now relative to this root. For example, `boba run` will know to look for a `src/main.boba` file and execute its `main()` function. `boba build` will place artifacts in a `build/` or `target/` directory within the project root.

## Designing `boba init`

The `boba init` command is your user's entry point into Project Mode. It's your chance to establish a clean, standard project structure that solves the "ecosystem tax" from day one.

When a user runs `boba init my_awesome_project`, the tool should create the following structure:

```text
my_awesome_project/
├── .gitignore
├── boba.toml
└── src/
    └── main.boba
```

### `boba.toml`: A pre-populated project manifest

```toml
[project]
name = "my_awesome_project"
version = "0.1.0"
license = "MIT"

[dependencies]

# To specify a git repository, you use an inline table.
# At a minimum, you must provide the git URL.
# By default, Boba will use the latest commit on the default branch.
http = { git = "https://github.com/boba-lang/http" }

# To pin to a specific version tag (BEST PRACTICE for releases)
json = { git = "https://github.com/boba-lang/json", tag = "v1.2.0" }

# To pin to a specific commit hash for absolute reproducibility
data_structures = { git = "https://github.com/user/boba-dstruct", rev = "f4aa7b123c..." }

# To pin to a specific branch (for development or bleeding-edge versions)
# WARNING: This is not recommended for stable applications.
logging = { git = "https://github.com/boba-lang/log", branch = "feature/new-format" }

```

### `src/main.boba`: A default entry point file

```boba
// The main entry point for the project.
// This function is executed when you run `boba run` in the project directory.
pub fn main() -> void {
  print("Hello, world!")
}
