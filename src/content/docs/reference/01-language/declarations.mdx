title: Declarations
---

Declarations are how you introduce new names into your program, such as variables, constants, functions, and custom types.

## Variables and Constants (`var` and `const`)

In Boba, you can declare variables using the `var` and `const` keywords.

### `var`

Use `var` to declare mutable variables. The type can be specified explicitly or inferred by the compiler from the value assigned at declaration.

```boba
var x: number = 2
y, z: number = 3, 4 // y and z must be the same type

// Types are inferenced at declaration
var a = 5
var name = "Boba"
```

### `const`

Use `const` to declare immutable constants. Once a value is assigned to a `const`, it cannot be changed.

Note that `const` provides deep immutability; fields of a constant `struct` or properties of a constant `class` instance cannot be modified after declaration.

```boba
const A: number = 1
struct Point = { x: number, y: number }
const BEST_POINT: Point = { x = 10, y = 20 }
var x: Point = { x = 15, y = 25 }

A = 10 // COMPILE ERROR: Cannot assign to 'A' because it is a constant.
BEST_POINT.x = 30 // COMPILE ERROR: Cannot assign to 'x' because it is a constant.
BEST_POINT = x // COMPILE ERROR: Cannot assign to 'BEST_POINT' because it is a constant.
```

## Functions (`fn`)

Functions are reusable, named blocks of code that perform a specific task. They are a fundamental building block for organizing and structuring your programs.

### Defining a Function

Functions are defined using the `fn` keyword. You can specify argument types and a return type.

```boba
// A public function with no arguments and no return value
pub fn my_function() -> void {
  print("This is a function")
}

// A function with arguments and a return value
pub fn add(a: number, b: number) -> number {
  return a + b
}

// A private function (only accessible within the current file)
fn my_private_function() -> void {
  print("Don't tell anyone about this!")
}
```

-   **Visibility**: Use `pub` to make a function public (callable from other files). Without `pub`, a function is private by default.
-   **Return Type**: The `->` syntax specifies the type of the value the function will return. If a function doesn't return a value, use `void`.

### Advanced Function Features

#### Default Parameters

You can assign a default value to a parameter, making it optional when the function is called.

```boba
// The `port` and `use_ssl` parameters are optional.
pub fn connect(host: string, port: number = 5432, use_ssl: boolean = true) {
  // ... connection logic ...
}

connect("example.com") // Uses default port and SSL settings
connect("example.com", 8080) // Overrides the port
```

#### Overloading

Boba allows you to define multiple functions with the same name but different parameter lists (either different types or a different number of parameters). The compiler will choose the correct function to call based on the arguments you provide.

```boba
// Overload 1: Takes two numbers
fn add(a: number, b: number) -> number {
  return a + b
}

// Overload 2: Takes two strings
fn add(a: string, b: string) -> string {
  return a + " " + b
}

var num_sum = add(5, 10)       // Calls the first overload, returns 15
var str_sum = add("hello", "world") // Calls the second overload, returns "hello world"
```

-   **Use Overloading for Different Semantics or Types**: Choose overloading when the function's core behavior changes based on the input types.
-   **Use Default Arguments for Optional Configuration**: Use default arguments when the core behavior is the same, but you want to provide optional flags or parameters to tweak it.

**Restriction**: An overload set cannot contain functions that only differ by parameters with default values, as it would create ambiguity.

## Custom Types

Boba provides three ways to define your own custom types: [Structs](./structs), [Enums](./enums), and [Classes](./classes).

-   **[Structs](./structs)**: Value types for grouping related data.
-   **[Enenums](./enums)**: Types that can be one of several distinct variants, perfect for representing state.
-   **[Classes](./classes)**: Reference types that bundle data and behavior, supporting inheritance.

## Built-in Functions

Boba includes a small set of essential built-in functions that are always available.

### `panic(message: string) -> void`

The `panic()` function triggers an unrecoverable error, immediately terminating the program.

When called, it prints the provided error `message` to the console, followed by a stack trace to help identify the source of the error. As the program unwinds, it will execute any `defer` statements that are in scope, ensuring that critical cleanup operations (like closing files) are performed.

A panic should be used only for unrecoverable errorsâ€”situations that indicate a bug in the program's logic and from which it is not safe to continue.

```boba
fn get_user_by_id(id: int) -> User {
  let user = db.query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {id}")?
  if user == None {
    // This state should be impossible if the database is consistent.
    // It indicates a bug elsewhere in the system.
    panic(f"Critical error: User with ID {id} not found, but should exist.")
  }
  return user
}
```
