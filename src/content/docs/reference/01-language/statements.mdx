Statements are the instructions that a Boba program executes. They control the flow of the program, from making decisions to repeating actions.

## Conditional Statements

Conditional statements allow you to execute different blocks of code based on whether a certain condition is true or false.

### `if`, `else if`, and `else`

This structure is used for straightforward conditional logic.

-   `if`: Executes a block of code if its condition is `true`.
-   `else if`: If the preceding `if` (or `else if`) condition is `false`, this block is checked.
-   `else`: If all preceding conditions are `false`, this block is executed.

```boba
var temperature = 20

if (temperature > 30) {
  print("It's a hot day!")
} else if (temperature < 10) {
  print("It's a cold day!")
} else {
  print("The weather is moderate.")
}
```

### `match` Statement

The `match` statement is a powerful tool for pattern matching that provides a more structured alternative to long `if-else if` chains.

```boba
match my_variable {
  1 => print("It was one!"),
  x where x > 100 => print("It's a big number: {x}"),
  s: string => print("It's a string of length {s.len()}"),
  _ => print("Default case") // `_` is a wildcard that matches any value
}
```

A `match` statement must be exhaustive, meaning every possible value must be covered. The wildcard `_` is often used to satisfy this requirement.

## Loop Statements

Loops are control flow structures that allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly.

### `for` loop

The `for` loop is used to iterate a specific number of times.

```boba
// Iterates from 1 up to and including 5, incrementing by 1
for i in 1 to 5 by 1 {
  print("I am print {i}!")
}
```

### `while` loop

The `while` loop executes a block of code as long as a given condition remains `true`.

```boba
var j: number = 0
while j < 10 {
  j++
  if j == 5 then break
}
```

### `foreach` loop

The `foreach` loop is the idiomatic way to iterate over all elements in a collection.

```boba
var book: string[] = ["Chapter 1", "Chapter 2", "Chapter 3"]
foreach page in book {
  read(page)
}
```

### `repeat` loop

The `repeat` loop (or do-while) checks its condition *after* each iteration, guaranteeing the body executes at least once.

```boba
var k: number = 0
repeat {
  k++
} until k == 10
```

### `break` and `continue`

The `break` and `continue` keywords provide fine-grained control over loop execution.

-   **`break`**: Immediately terminates the innermost loop.
-   **`continue`**: Skips the remainder of the current iteration and proceeds to the next one.

```boba
for i in 1 to 10 by 1 {
  if (i % 2 == 0) {
    continue // Skip even numbers
  }
  if (i == 7) {
    break // Exit loop if i is 7
  }
  print(i)
}
// Output: 1, 3, 5
```

## `defer` Statement

The `defer` statement schedules a function call to be executed when the surrounding function scope is exited. This is crucial for guaranteeing cleanup tasks, like closing files.

When a `defer` statement is encountered, the function call is put on a stack. When the function returns (either normally or through an error), the deferred calls are executed in Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) order.

This LIFO behavior can be demonstrated with the following example:

```boba
fn lifo_example() {
    print("Function Start")
    defer print("Cleanup 1: Runs Third")
    defer print("Cleanup 2: Runs Second")
    defer print("Cleanup 3: Runs First")
    print("Function End")
}
// Calling lifo_example() would print:
// > Function Start
// > Function End
// > Cleanup 3: Runs First
// > Cleanup 2: Runs Second
// > Cleanup 1: Runs Third
```

```boba
pub fn get_file_size(path: string) -> Result<number, error> {
    var file = fs.open(path)?
    // This guarantees the file will be closed when the function exits.
    defer file.close()

    var contents = file.read_all()?
    return Ok(contents.len())
}
