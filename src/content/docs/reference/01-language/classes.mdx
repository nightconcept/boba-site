title: Classes
---

Classes are blueprints for creating objects. They bundle data (properties) and functions that operate on that data (methods) into a single unit.

Classes are *reference types*. When you assign a class instance to a new variable, you are not creating a copy. Instead, you are creating a *reference* (or a pointer) to the exact same object in memory. Modifying the object through one reference will be reflected when accessing it through another.

## Defining a Class

You define a class using the `class` keyword.

```boba
class Enemy = {
  // Properties
  health: number
  mana: number

  // Initializer - sets starting values
  init() {
    self.health = 100
    self.mana = 50
  }

  // A public method
  pub fn take_damage(amount: number) -> void {
    self.health = self.health - amount
  }
}
```

-   **Properties**: Variables that belong to a class instance (e.g., `health`, `mana`).
-   **Methods**: Functions that belong to a class. Use `self` to access the current instance.
-   **`init` Block**: A special initializer block that is called when a new instance is created with `new`.
    -   It does **not** use the `fn` keyword.
    -   It cannot have a return type and cannot use the `return` keyword.
    -   It can be overloaded with different parameters, just like a function.

## Inheritance

Inheritance allows a class (subclass) to inherit from another class (superclass) using the `extends` keyword.

```boba
class Goblin extends Enemy = {
  gold: number = 12

  pub fn taunt() {
    print("Heh heh! I have {self.health} health left!")
  }
}

var goblin_scout = new Goblin()
goblin_scout.take_damage(20) // Inherited method
print(goblin_scout.gold)     // New property
