title: Types
---

A type is a classification that tells the compiler or interpreter how a programmer intends to use a piece of data. Boba is a statically-typed language, meaning the type of every variable is known at compile time.

## Primitive Types

Primitive types are the most basic data types available in Boba.

### `string`

A `string` is a sequence of characters used to represent text.

```boba
var name: string = "Boba Fett"
let constant_string = "Immutable" // Type is inferred
```

### `number`

The `number` type represents a 64-bit floating-point number (double-precision). It's used for both integer and fractional values.

```boba
var price: number = 20.0
var quantity = 3 // Type is inferred
let pi: number = 3.14159
```

> **Note on Precision**: Boba's number type is suitable for a vast range of applications, but be aware of standard floating-point precision limitations when dealing with very large integers (greater than 2^53).

### `boolean`

A `boolean` represents one of two values: `true` or `false`. It's primarily used for conditional logic.

```boba
var is_active: boolean = true
let has_permission = false // Type is inferred
```

## Composite Types

Composite types, also known as aggregate types, are composed of primitive types and other composite types. These are covered in more detail in other documents:
