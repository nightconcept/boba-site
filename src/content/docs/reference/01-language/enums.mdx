Enumerations (or enums) allow you to define a custom type by listing its possible values, known as variants. They are useful for creating types that can only hold a specific set of values, making your code more robust and expressive.

## Defining a Simple Enum

You define an enum with the `enum` keyword.

```boba
enum Direction {
  NORTH,
  SOUTH,
  EAST,
  WEST
}
```

## Using an Enum

```boba
var player_direction: Direction = Direction.NORTH

if (player_direction == Direction.NORTH) {
  print("You are heading north.")
}
```

## Enums with Data (Associated Values)

Boba enums can also hold additional data. Each variant can have different types and amounts of associated data. This makes them incredibly powerful for modeling complex states.

```boba
enum Shape {
  Circle(radius: number),
  Rectangle(width: number, height: number)
}

var my_shape = Shape.Circle(radius = 10.5)
var another_shape = Shape.Rectangle(width = 5, height = 10)
```

When combined with the `match` statement, enums with associated values allow for elegant and type-safe handling of different cases.
