title: Expressions
---

Expressions are pieces of code that produce a value. They are the building blocks of statements. An expression can be as simple as a literal value or as complex as a combination of operators and function calls.

## Literals

Literals are fixed values that you write directly in your code.

-   **Number Literals**: `10`, `3.14`, `-5.5`
-   **String Literals**: `"hello"`, `'world'`
-   **Boolean Literals**: `true`, `false`
-   **Null Literal**: `null` (represents the absence of a value)
-   **List Literals**: `[1, 2, 3]`
-   **Map Literals**: `{"key": "value"}`

```boba
var is_active: boolean = true
var user_data = null // Could be used before user data is loaded
```

## Operators

Operators are special symbols that perform operations on operands (values and variables).

### Arithmetic Operators

| Operator | Description      | Example              |
| :------- | :--------------- | :------------------- |
| `+`      | Addition         | `5 + 2`  // 7         |
| `-`      | Subtraction      | `5 - 2`  // 3         |
| `*`      | Multiplication   | `5 * 2`  // 10        |
| `/`      | Division         | `5 / 2`  // 2.5       |
| `%`      | Modulo/Remainder | `5 % 2`  // 1         |
| `^`      | Power            | `5 ^ 2`  // 25        |

### Comparison and Relational Operators

These operators compare two operands and return a `boolean` (`true` or `false`).

| Operator | Description               |
| :------- | :------------------------ |
| `==`     | Equal to                  |
| `!=`     | Not equal to              |
| `<`      | Less than                 |
| `>`      | Greater than              |
| `<=`     | Less than or equal to     |
| `>=`     | Greater than or equal to  |

### Logical Operators

These operators are used to combine `boolean` expressions.

-   `and`: Logical AND (returns `true` if both operands are `true`).
-   `or`: Logical OR (returns `true` if at least one operand is `true`).
-   `not`: Logical NOT (inverts a `boolean` value).

### Equality (`==` and `!=`) Behavior

The behavior of equality operators depends on the type:

| Type    | Behavior                                                                           |
| :------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `number`  | Compares numerical values.                                                         |
| `boolean` | Compares the boolean values.                                                       |
| `string`  | Compares the contents of the strings character by character.                       |
| `list`    | **Compares by reference**. Two lists are equal only if they are the *same object*. |
| `struct`  | **Compares by value**. Two structs are equal if all their corresponding fields are equal. |
| `class`   | **Compares by reference**. Two class instances are equal only if they are the *same object*. |
