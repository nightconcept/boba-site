Collections are data structures that can hold multiple values. Boba provides two primary collection types: Lists and Maps.

## Lists

Lists are ordered, resizable collections of items of the same type. They are one of the most common ways to group data in Boba.

### Creating a List

You define a list by specifying the type of its elements followed by `[]`.

```boba
// A list of numbers
var high_scores: number[] = [100, 95, 80]

// A list of strings
var ingredients: string[] = ["flour", "sugar", "boba pearls"]

// An empty list must have its type declared
var empty_list: string[] = []
```

### Accessing and Modifying Elements

You access elements in a list using zero-based indexing (the first element is at index 0).

```boba
print(ingredients[0]) // Outputs "flour"

// You can change the value at a specific index
ingredients[2] = "tapioca pearls"
print(ingredients) // Outputs ["flour", "sugar", "tapioca pearls"]
```

### Multi-dimensional Lists

Boba supports multi-dimensional lists (lists of lists), which can be used to create matrices or grids.

```boba
// A 2x3 matrix (2 rows, 3 columns)
var matrix: number[][] = [
  [1, 2, 3],
  [4, 5, 6]
]

// Accessing an element
var value: number = matrix[1][2] // value is 6
```

## Maps

Maps are collections of key-value pairs. Each key in a map must be unique. They are useful for storing associated data, like a dictionary or a lookup table.

### Creating a Map

You can create a map using curly braces `{}` and specifying key-value pairs.

#### Explicit Typing

You can explicitly declare the types for the keys and values.

```boba
// A map with string keys and number values
var scores: [string:number] = {
  "ada": 100,
  "grace": 95
}
```

#### Type Inference

Boba can also infer the types from the data you provide.

```boba
// Types are inferred as [string:string]
var actions = {
  "add": "added",
  "subtract": "subtracted"
}
```

### Accessing and Modifying Values

You can access and modify values in a map using their keys.

```boba
print(scores["ada"]) // Outputs 100

scores["grace"] = 98 // Updates the value for the key "grace"
scores["boba"] = 105 // Adds a new key-value pair
