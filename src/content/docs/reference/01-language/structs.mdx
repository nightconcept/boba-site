title: Structs
---

Structures (or `structs`) are custom data types you can define to group together related variables into a logical unit. They are a fundamental way to model the data in your application.

Structs are *value types*. When you assign a struct to a new variable or pass it to a function, the entire struct is *copied*. This means that modifications to the copy will not affect the original.

## Defining a Structure

You define a structure using the `struct` keyword, followed by the name of the struct and a block of fields with their types.

```boba
// This defines a "Player" structure.
struct Player = {
  name: string,
  score: number,
  is_active: boolean
}
```

## Creating an Instance

Once a struct is defined, you can create instances (variables) of that type.

```boba
// Create a new variable "ada" of type "Player"
var ada: Player = { name = "Ada", score = 100, is_active = true }
```

## Accessing and Modifying Fields

You access the data within a struct instance using dot (`.`) notation.

```boba
print("Player's score: {ada.score}") // Outputs: Player's score: 100
ada.score = ada.score + 10
print("New score: {ada.score}") // Outputs: New score: 110
