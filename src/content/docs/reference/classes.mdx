Boba supports classes and inheritance.

```boba
class Enemy = {
  health: number = 100

  fn take_damage(amount: number) -> void {
    self.health = self.health - amount
  }
}

class Goblin extends Enemy = {
  gold: number = 12

  fn taunt() {
    print("Heh heh heh! I have {self.health} health left!")
  }
}
