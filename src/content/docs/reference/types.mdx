Boba Lang supports the following primitive types:

- `string`
- `number` - C double underneath the hood
- `function`
- `boolean`
- `list` - Dynamic array underneath the hood
- `struct`
- `class`

*Note: Boba's number type is a 64-bit floating-point number. While suitable for a vast range of applications, programmers should be aware of standard floating-point precision limitations when dealing with very large integers (greater than 2^53).*
