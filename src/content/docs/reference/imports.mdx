## Imports

Individual functions (they must be public) and all functions from a file can be imported. All overloads are also imported.

Circular imports are disallowed.

Imported functions can be renamed.

```boba
import func1, func2 from "relative/path/from/this/file.boba"
import * from "relative/path/from/this/file2.boba"
import func1 as func3 from "relative/path/from/this/file3.boba"
```
