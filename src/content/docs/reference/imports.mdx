title: Imports

Imports allow you to use code defined in other files, enabling you to organize your project into modules. You can import public functions, classes, structs, and enums.

## Import Syntax

Import statements are placed at the top of a Boba file.

### Importing Specific Items

You can import one or more specific items from a file. This is the most common way to import.

```boba
// Imports `func1` and `func2` from the specified file.
import func1, func2 from "relative/path/from/this/file.boba"
```

### Importing All Items

You can import all public items from a file using the `*` wildcard. Use this with caution, as it can pull in many names and potentially cause conflicts.

```boba
// Imports all public members from file2.boba
import * from "relative/path/from/this/file2.boba"
```

### Renaming Imports

You can rename an imported item using the `as` keyword. This is useful for avoiding naming collisions or for giving an item a more descriptive name in the current context.

```boba
// Imports `func1` but renames it to `func3` in the current file.
import func1 as func3 from "relative/path/from/this/file3.boba"
```

## Important Rules

-   **Paths**: Import paths are always relative to the file containing the import statement.
-   **Visibility**: You can only import items that are marked as `pub` (public) in the other file.
-   **Overloads**: When you import a function, all of its overloads are imported as well.
-   **Circular Imports**: File A cannot import File B if File B already imports File A (or if there is a longer chain of imports that leads back to File A). This is disallowed and will result in a compile error.
