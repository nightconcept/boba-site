title: Match
---

The `match` statement is a powerful control flow construct that allows you to compare a value against a series of patterns and execute code based on which pattern matches. It is often more readable and expressive than a long chain of `if-else if` statements.

## Structure of a `match` Statement

A `match` statement consists of the `match` keyword followed by an expression, and a block of `=>` separated arms. Each arm has a pattern and an expression to execute if the pattern matches.

```boba
match my_variable {
  pattern_1 => expression_1,
  pattern_2 => expression_2,
  _ => default_expression // The wildcard `_` is the default case
}
```

## Patterns

`match` arms can use a variety of patterns:

-   **Literal Values**: Match against a specific value.
    ```boba
    match status_code {
      200 => print("OK"),
      404 => print("Not Found"),
      _ => print("Some other status")
    }
    ```
-   **Variable Binding**: Bind the matched value to a new variable.
    ```boba
    match some_value {
      s: string => print("It's a string of length {s.len()}"),
      n: number => print("It's a number: {n}")
    }
    ```
-   **Guards**: Add a `where` clause to an arm for more complex conditions.
    ```boba
    match some_number {
      x where x > 100 => print("It's a big number: {x}"),
      x where x < 0 => print("It's a negative number: {x}"),
      _ => print("It's a number between 0 and 100")
    }
    ```
-   **Wildcard**: The `_` pattern acts as a catch-all, matching any value that wasn't caught by the preceding arms. It is required for ensuring the `match` is exhaustive.

## Exhaustiveness

A `match` statement must be exhaustive, meaning that every possible value of the matched expression must be covered by one of the arms. The wildcard `_` is often used to satisfy this requirement.
