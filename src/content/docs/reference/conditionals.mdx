title: Conditionals

Conditional statements allow you to execute different blocks of code based on whether a certain condition is true or false. Boba provides `if`, `else if`, `else`, and a `match` statement for this purpose.

## `if`, `else if`, and `else`

This structure is used for straightforward conditional logic.

-   `if`: Executes a block of code if its condition is `true`.
-   `else if`: If the preceding `if` (or `else if`) condition is `false`, this block is checked. You can have multiple `else if` blocks.
-   `else`: If all preceding conditions are `false`, this block is executed.

```boba
var temperature = 20

if (temperature > 30) {
  print("It's a hot day!")
} else if (temperature < 10) {
  print("It's a cold day!")
} else {
  print("The weather is moderate.")
}
```

## `match` Statement

The `match` statement is a powerful tool for pattern matching that provides a more structured and readable alternative to long `if-else if` chains, especially when checking one variable against multiple possible values or patterns.

```boba
// Hypothetical Boba match statement
match my_variable {
  1 => print("It was one!"),
  x where x > 100 => print("It's a big number: {x}"),
  s: string => print("It's a string of length {s.len()}"),
  _ => print("Default case") // `_` is a wildcard that matches any value
}
```

Key features of `match`:
-   It compares a single value against multiple patterns.
-   It can bind values to new variables (e.g., `x` and `s`).
-   It can include conditional logic with `where` clauses.
-   The wildcard `_` acts as a default case, catching any values not matched by other arms.
