title: Loops

Loops are control flow structures that allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly. Boba provides several types of loops to handle different scenarios.

## `for` loop

The `for` loop is used to iterate a specific number of times. It includes a start value, an end value, and a step value.

```boba
// Iterates from 1 up to and including 5, incrementing by 1
for i in 1 to 5 by 1 {
  // String interpolation is supported using {variable_name}
  print("I am print {i}!")
}

// To escape curly braces, use a double backslash: \\{ and \\}
```

## `while` loop

The `while` loop executes a block of code as long as a given condition remains `true`. The condition is checked *before* each iteration.

```boba
var j: number = 0
while j < 10 {
  j++
  print("I am print {j}!")
  if j == 5 then break // The `break` keyword exits the loop immediately
}
```

## `foreach` loop

The `foreach` loop is the idiomatic way to iterate over all elements in a collection, such as a list or a map.

```boba
var book: string[] = ["Chapter 1", "Chapter 2", "Chapter 3"]

foreach page in book {
  read(page)
}
```

## `repeat` loop

The `repeat` loop (also known as a do-while loop in other languages) is similar to a `while` loop, but the condition is checked *after* each iteration. This guarantees that the loop body will be executed at least once.

```boba
var k: number = 0
repeat {
  print("Repeating!")
  k++
} until k == 10
```
