title: Types
---

A type is a classification that tells the compiler or interpreter how a programmer intends to use a piece of data. Boba is a statically-typed language, meaning the type of every variable is known at compile time.

## Primitive Types

Primitive types are the most basic data types available in Boba.

### `string`

A `string` is a sequence of characters used to represent text.

```boba
var name: string = "Boba Fett"
let constant_string = "Immutable" // Type is inferred
```

### `number`

The `number` type represents a 64-bit floating-point number (double-precision). It's used for both integer and fractional values.

```boba
var price: number = 20.0
var quantity = 3 // Type is inferred
let pi: number = 3.14159
```

> **Note on Precision**: Boba's number type is suitable for a vast range of applications, but be aware of standard floating-point precision limitations when dealing with very large integers (greater than 2^53).

### `boolean`

A `boolean` represents one of two values: `true` or `false`. It's primarily used for conditional logic.

```boba
var is_active: boolean = true
let has_permission = false // Type is inferred
```

## Composite Types

Composite types, also known as aggregate types, are composed of primitive types and other composite types.

### `list`

A `list` is an ordered, resizable collection of elements of a single type.

For more details, see the [`list`](/docs/reference/lists/) reference.

```boba
var scores: number[] = [100, 95, 88]
let names: string[] = ["Ada", "Grace", "Hedy"]
```

### `map`

A `map` is an unordered collection of key-value pairs. All keys must be of the same type, and all values must be of the same type.

For more details, see the [`map`](/docs/reference/maps/) reference.

```boba
var user_scores: [string:number] = {
  "ada": 100,
  "grace": 95
}
```

### `struct`

A `struct` (or structure) is a custom composite type that lets you group related variables of different types into a named collection.

For more details, see the [`struct`](/docs/reference/structures/) reference.

```boba
// Definition
struct Point {
  x: number,
  y: number,
}

// Usage
var p1: Point = Point(x: 10, y: 20)
```

### `enum`

An `enum` (or enumeration) allows you to define a custom type by enumerating its possible values.

For more details, see the [`enum`](/docs/reference/enumerations/) reference.

```boba
// Definition
enum Status {
  Pending,
  InProgress,
  Completed,
  Failed,
}

// Usage
var current_status: Status = Status.InProgress
```

### `class`

A `class` is a blueprint for creating objects. It bundles data (properties) and methods (functions) that operate on that data.

For more details, see the [`class`](/docs/reference/classes/) reference.

```boba
// Definition
class Player {
  name: string
  score: number = 0

  pub fn new(name: string) {
    self.name = name
  }

  pub fn increase_score(amount: number) {
    self.score += amount
  }
}

// Usage
var player1 = Player("Zoe")
player1.increase_score(10)
```

## Other Types

### `function`

Functions are also a type in Boba. This allows them to be passed as arguments to other functions or assigned to variables.

For more details, see the [`function`](/docs/reference/functions/) reference.

```boba
fn add(a: number, b: number) -> number {
  return a + b
}

// Assign a function to a variable
var operation: fn(number, number) -> number = add

// Use the variable to call the function
var result = operation(5, 10) // result is 15
```
