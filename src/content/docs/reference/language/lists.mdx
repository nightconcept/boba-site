Lists are ordered, resizable collections of items of the same type. They are one of the most common ways to group data in Boba.

## Creating a List

You define a list by specifying the type of its elements followed by `[]`.

```boba
// A list of numbers
var high_scores: number[] = [100, 95, 80]

// A list of strings
var ingredients: string[] = ["flour", "sugar", "boba pearls"]

// An empty list must have its type declared
var empty_list: string[] = []
```

## Accessing and Modifying Elements

You access elements in a list using zero-based indexing (the first element is at index 0).

```boba
print(ingredients[0]) // Outputs "flour"

// You can change the value at a specific index
ingredients[2] = "tapioca pearls"
print(ingredients) // Outputs ["flour", "sugar", "tapioca pearls"]
```

## Multi-dimensional Lists

Boba supports multi-dimensional lists (lists of lists), which can be used to create matrices or grids.

### Uniform 2D Lists (Matrices)

```boba
// A 2x3 matrix (2 rows, 3 columns)
var matrix: number[][] = [
  [1, 2, 3],
  [4, 5, 6]
]

// Accessing an element
var value: number = matrix[1][2] // value is 6
```

### Jagged Lists

You can also create lists where the inner lists have different lengths.

```boba
var jagged: number[][] = [
  [10, 20],
  [30, 40, 50],
  [60]
]

print(jagged[1][1]) // prints 40
```
