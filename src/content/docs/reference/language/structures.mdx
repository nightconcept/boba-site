Structures (or `structs`) are custom data types you can define to group together related variables into a logical unit. They are a way to create more complex, organized data.

## Defining a Structure

You define a structure using the `struct` keyword, followed by the name of the struct and a block of fields with their types.

```boba
// This defines a "Player" structure.
struct Player = {
  name: string,
  score: number,
  is_active: boolean
}
```

## Creating an Instance

Once a struct is defined, you can create instances (variables) of that type.

```boba
// Create a new variable "ada" of type "Player"
var ada: Player = { name = "Ada", score = 100, is_active = true }

// You can also let Boba infer the type
var boba_player = { name = "Boba", score = 9001, is_active = true }
```

## Accessing and Modifying Fields

You access the data within a struct instance using dot (`.`) notation.

```boba
print("Player's score: {ada.score}") // Outputs: Player's score: 100

// Fields of a `var` instance can be modified
ada.score = ada.score + 10
print("New score: {ada.score}") // Outputs: New score: 110
```

## Structs vs. Classes

Structs are similar to [Classes](./classes.mdx), but with a key difference:

-   **Structs (Value Types)**: When you assign a struct to a new variable or pass it to a function, a *copy* of the data is made. They are compared by their values.
-   **Classes (Reference Types)**: When you work with classes, you are working with a *reference* to the object. They are compared by their reference in memory.

Choose a struct when you need a simple data container. Choose a class when you need more complex behavior, methods, and inheritance.
