Enumerations (or enums) allow you to define a custom type by listing its possible values, known as variants. They make code clearer and safer by restricting a variable to a known set of values.

## Defining a Simple Enum

You define an enum with the `enum` keyword.

```boba
enum Direction {
  NORTH,
  SOUTH,
  EAST,
  WEST
}
```

## Using an Enum

Once defined, you can use the enum as a type. Variants are accessed directly through the enum's name.

```boba
var player_direction: Direction = Direction.NORTH

if (player_direction == Direction.NORTH) {
  print("You are heading north.")
}
```

## Enums with Data (Associated Values)

Boba enums can also hold additional data, making them incredibly powerful. This is a key feature for patterns like the `Result` type used in [Error Handling](./error-handling.mdx).

Each variant can have different types and amounts of associated data.

```boba
enum Shape {
  Circle(radius: number),
  Rectangle(width: number, height: number)
}

var my_shape = Shape.Circle(radius = 10.5)
var another_shape = Shape.Rectangle(width = 5, height = 10)
```

This allows you to store more detailed information within the enum itself, creating rich, expressive data structures.
