title: Comments
---

Comments are annotations in your code that are ignored by the compiler. They are used to explain what your code does, making it more understandable for yourself and others.

Boba supports two types of comments.

## Single-line comments

Single-line comments start with `//` and continue to the end of the line. They are useful for short explanations.

```boba
// This is a comment
var x = 5 // This is also a comment
```

## Block comments

Block comments start with `/*` and end with `*/`. They can span multiple lines and are useful for longer explanations.

```boba
/*
This is a block comment.
It can span multiple lines.
*/
```
