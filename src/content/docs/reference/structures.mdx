In Boba, you can define custom data structures for your objects using the `struct` keyword.

## Defining a Structure

Use the `struct` keyword to define the blueprint for a new data structure.

```boba
// This defines a "Player" structure.
struct Player = {
  name: string,
  score: number,
  is_active: boolean
}
```

## Creating an Instance

Once you have defined a structure, you can create variables that use it. When you create an instance of a structure, you don't need to specify the types of the fields again.

```boba
// Create a new variable "ada" of type "Player"
var ada: Player = { name = "Ada", score = 100, is_active = true }
```
