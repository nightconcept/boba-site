Operators are special symbols that perform operations on operands (values and variables). Boba supports a range of arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators.

## Arithmetic Operators

These operators perform mathematical calculations.

| Operator | Description      | Example              |
| :------- | :--------------- | :------------------- |
| `+`      | Addition         | `5 + 2`  // 7         |
| `-`      | Subtraction      | `5 - 2`  // 3         |
| `*`      | Multiplication   | `5 * 2`  // 10        |
| `/`      | Division         | `5 / 2`  // 2.5       |
| `%`      | Modulo/Remainder | `5 % 2`  // 1         |
| `^`      | Power            | `5 ^ 2`  // 25        |

### Unary Arithmetic

These operators modify a single numeric variable.

-   `++`: Increments the value by 1.
-   `--`: Decrements the value by 1.

```boba
var score = 10
score++ // score is now 11
```

## Comparison and Relational Operators

These operators compare two operands and return a `boolean` (`true` or `false`).

| Operator | Description               |
| :------- | :------------------------ |
| `==`     | Equal to                  |
| `!=`     | Not equal to              |
| `<`      | Less than                 |
| `>`      | Greater than              |
| `<=`     | Less than or equal to     |
| `>=`     | Greater than or equal to  |

### Strict Boolean Evaluations

In conditional contexts like `if` statements, Boba requires an actual `boolean` value. You cannot use non-boolean types as a shorthand for `true` or `false`.

-   **Wrong**: `if (score) { ... }` where `score` is a `number`.
-   **Correct**: `if (score != 0) { ... }` which produces a `boolean`.

## Logical Operators

These operators are used to combine `boolean` expressions.

-   `and`: Logical AND (returns `true` if both operands are `true`).
-   `or`: Logical OR (returns `true` if at least one operand is `true`).
-   `not`: Logical NOT (inverts a `boolean` value).

## Equality `==` and `!=` Behavior

The behavior of the equality operators depends on the type of the operands.

| Type    | Behavior                                                                           | Example                                                                     |
| :------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `number`  | Compares numerical values.                                                         | `5 == 5.0` is `true`                                                        |
| `boolean` | Compares the boolean values.                                                       | `true == true` is `true`                                                    |
| `string`  | Compares the contents of the strings character by character.                       | `"hello" == "hello"` is `true`                                              |
| `list`    | **Compares by reference**. Two lists are equal only if they are the *same object*. | `var a = [1]; var b = [1]; a == b` is `false`. `var c = a; a == c` is `true`. |
| `struct`  | **Compares by value**. Two structs are equal if all their corresponding fields are equal. | `var p1 = {x=1}; var p2 = {x=1}; p1 == p2` is `true`.                        |
| `class`   | **Comares by reference**. Two class instances are equal only if they are the *same object*. | `var g1 = new G(); var g2 = new G(); g1 == g2` is `false`.                 |
