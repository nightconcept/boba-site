title: Constants

Constants are special, unchangeable values that are built directly into the Boba language. They represent fundamental concepts.

Boba has the following built-in constants:

-   `true`: A `boolean` value representing truth.
-   `false`: A `boolean` value representing falsehood.
-   `null`: Represents the intentional absence of any object value. It is often used to indicate that a variable has no value.

```boba
var is_active: boolean = true
var has_key: boolean = false
var user_data = null // Could be used before user data is loaded
```

For creating your own unchangeable values, see [Variables and Constants](learn/01-variables-and-constants.mdx) and the `const` keyword.
