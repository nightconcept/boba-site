title: Functions
---

Functions are defined using the `fn` keyword. You can specify argument types and return types.

```boba
// Public function
pub fn myFunction() -> void {
  print("This is a function")
}

pub fn myFunctionWithArgs(a: number, b: number) -> number {
  return a + b
}

// Private functions are only accessible within the file declared in.
// Not having pub makes a function private.
fn myPrivateFunction() -> void {
  print("Don't tell anyone about this!")
}

## Overloading

Allowed. An overload resolution algorithm must be implemented.

## Default Parameters

Allowed.

## Guidance

Use Overloading for Different Semantics or Types. The core behavior of the function changes based on the type of input.

```boba
// Behavior is different for a number vs. a list
pub fn create_buffer(size: number) { /* Allocate a new buffer */ }
pub fn create_buffer(from_data: number[]) { /* Copy data into a new buffer */ }
```

Use Default Arguments for Optional Configuration. The core behavior is the same, but you are providing optional flags or parameters to tweak it.
```boba
// Behavior is always connecting, but port and ssl are optional tweaks
pub fn connect(host: string, port: number = 5432, use_ssl: boolean = true) { ... }
```

An overload set should not contain functions that only differ by parameters with default values.
