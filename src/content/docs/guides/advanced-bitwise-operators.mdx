While arithmetic operators work on a number's mathematical value, **bitwise operators** allow you to manipulate the individual `1`s and `0`s (bits) that make up an `int`. This is a powerful technique for efficiently storing sets of on/off flags, working with certain data formats, and performance-critical code.

#### The Scenario: Player Permissions

Let's imagine we're building a game where a player has guild permissions. We can store all their permissions in a single `int`. First, we define each permission as a constant, using powers of two to ensure each one occupies a unique bit.

```boba
// Each permission corresponds to a single bit.
let CAN_INVITE:  int = 1  // Binary: ...0001
let CAN_KICK:    int = 2  // Binary: ...0010
let CAN_PROMOTE: int = 4  // Binary: ...0100
```

#### Combining Flags with OR (`|`)

To grant a player multiple permissions, we use the bitwise OR operator. It combines the bits from both numbers.
```boba
// Let's grant a player permission to invite AND kick members.
let player_perms: int = CAN_INVITE | CAN_KICK
// In binary: 0001 | 0010  =  0011 (Decimal 3)
```

#### Checking for a Flag with AND (`&`)

To check if a player has a _specific_ permission, we use the bitwise AND operator. This is the most common bitwise operation.

```boba
// Does our player (perms value is 3) have permission to kick?
// The result will be non-zero only if the CAN_KICK bit is set.
if player_perms & CAN_KICK != 0 {
  print("Yes, this player can kick.") // This will print.
}

// Do they have permission to promote?
if player_perms & CAN_PROMOTE == 0 {
  print("No, this player cannot promote.") // This will print.
}
```

#### Other Bitwise Operators

Boba also supports other standard bitwise operators for advanced use cases:

- **`^` (XOR):** Toggles a bit (useful for flipping a state).
- **`~` (NOT):** Flips all bits in a number.
- **`<<` (Left Shift) and `>>` (Right Shift):** Move all bits to the left or right (useful for low-level data packing and fast multiplication/division by two).
```boba
let x: int = 4 // Binary: 0100

// Left shift by 1 (multiplies by 2)
print(x << 1) // Outputs 8 (Binary: 1000)

// Right shift by 2 (divides by 4)
print(x >> 2) // Outputs 1 (Binary: 0001)
