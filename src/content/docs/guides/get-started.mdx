## Boba Lang

Boba is a modern scripting language for high productivity human and AI collaboration.

### Features
- Type-safety with static typing.
- Interpreted, but will be compiled in the near future.
- Garbage collection to prevent memory safety issues.
- Explicit and clear syntax to prevent errors.
- Readable at-a-glance syntax.
- Designed with immutability in mind.
- Unified tooling for developer experience and simplicity.

### Design Goals

- Functional/Imperative hybrid programming to get things done safely using LLMs to generate code and humans to review and improve upon.
- Minimalistic features to prevent over-engineering.
- Retain C-style syntax for familiarity and ease of learning as most code ever written is in a C-style language.


### Background

I, [Danny Solivan](https://solivan.dev), designed Boba as a language I wanted to use with LLMs to get things done quickly. I use Python a lot for my work, but I grew frustrated with the ecosystem and tooling. I loved using Go and Zig's toolchains as they are packaged together and easy to use. I also saw that the future of coding is LLMs writing a large portion of it. So, I wanted to create a language that was easy to use and understand, but also had the power to be used with LLMs. I also wanted to learn about language design and implementation. To solve all those issues, I made Boba.
