This page will host the formal EBNF (Extended Backus-Naur Form) grammar for Boba Lang.

```ebnf
(* --- Lexical Grammar --- *)

identifier ::= letter { letter | digit | "_" } (* `snake_case` for values, `PascalCase` for types by convention *)

letter ::= "a"..."z" | "A"..."Z" | "_"
digit  ::= "0"..."9"

(* Literals represent concrete values *)
literal ::= integer_literal
          | float_literal
          | string_literal
          | f_string_literal
          | boolean_literal
          | "None"

integer_literal ::= decimal_literal | hex_literal | binary_literal
decimal_literal ::= digit { [ "_" ] digit }
hex_literal     ::= "0x" hex_digit { [ "_" ] hex_digit }
binary_literal  ::= "0b" binary_digit { [ "_" ] binary_digit }
hex_digit       ::= digit | "a"..."f" | "A"..."F"
binary_digit    ::= "0" | "1"

float_literal ::= digit { [ "_" ] digit } "." digit { [ "_" ] digit }

string_literal ::= '"' { character } '"'
f_string_literal ::= 'f' '"' { character | "{" expression "}" } '"'
character ::= (* any character except ", \, or newline, plus escape sequences like \n, \", \\ *)

boolean_literal ::= "true" | "false"

(* Comments are processed by the lexer and ignored by the parser *)
comment ::= line_comment | doc_comment
line_comment ::= "//" (* rest of line *)
doc_comment ::= ( "///" | "//!") (* rest of line *)

(* --- Type Expressions --- *)

type ::= identifier [ type_arguments ] (* e.g., Player, Option<string> *)
       | list_type
       | map_type

type_arguments ::= "<" type { "," type } ">"
list_type      ::= type "[]"
map_type       ::= "[" type ":" type "]"

(* --- Statements --- *)

statement ::= let_declaration
            | var_declaration
            | expression_statement
            | return_statement
            | defer_statement
            | panic_statement
            | block_statement

(* Declarations introduce new bindings *)
let_declaration ::= "let" identifier [ ":" type ] "=" expression
var_declaration ::= "var" identifier [ ":" type ] "=" expression

(* Other statements *)
expression_statement ::= expression
return_statement ::= "return" [ expression ]
defer_statement  ::= "defer" expression
panic_statement  ::= "panic" [ "(" expression ")" ]
block_statement  ::= "{" { statement } "}"

(* --- Expressions (by precedence) --- *)

expression ::= assignment_expression

assignment_expression ::= logical_or_expression [ assignment_operator expression ]
assignment_operator   ::= "=" | "+=" | "-=" | "*=" | "/=" | "%=" | "^=" | "|=" | "&=" | "<<=" | ">>="

logical_or_expression ::= logical_and_expression { "or" logical_and_expression }

logical_and_expression ::= coalescing_expression { "and" coalescing_expression }

coalescing_expression ::= equality_expression [ "??" equality_expression ]

equality_expression ::= comparison_expression { ( "==" | "!=" ) comparison_expression }

comparison_expression ::= pipe_expression { ( "<" | ">" | "<=" | ">=" | "in" | "not" "in" ) pipe_expression }

pipe_expression ::= additive_expression { "|>" call_expression } (* `|>` has low precedence *)

additive_expression ::= multiplicative_expression { ( "+" | "-" ) multiplicative_expression }

multiplicative_expression ::= power_expression { ( "*" | "/" | "%" ) power_expression }

power_expression ::= unary_expression { "^" unary_expression } (* `^` is right-associative *)

unary_expression ::= ( "not" | "-" | "await" ) unary_expression
                   | postfix_expression

postfix_expression ::= primary_expression { call_suffix | index_suffix | property_access }

index_suffix         ::= "[" expression "]"
property_access      ::= "." identifier

primary_expression ::= literal
                   | identifier
                   | "(" expression ")"
                   | if_expression
                   | match_expression
                   | list_literal
                   | map_literal

(* --- Expression-like Constructs --- *)

if_expression ::= "if" expression block_statement [ "else" ( if_expression | block_statement ) ]

match_expression ::= "match" expression "{" { match_arm } "}"
match_arm        ::= pattern [ "where" expression ] "=>" ( expression | block_statement ) ","
pattern          ::= literal | identifier | "_" | identifier "(" [ pattern_list ] ")" | "{" [ field_pattern_list ] "}"
pattern_list     ::= pattern { "," pattern }
field_pattern_list ::= identifier ":" pattern { "," identifier ":" pattern }
(* NOTE: EBNF describes syntax. The compiler enforces that `match` is exhaustive. *)


list_literal ::= "[" [ expression { "," expression } [","] ] "]"

map_literal ::= "{" [ map_entry { "," map_entry } [","] ] "}"
map_entry   ::= expression ":" expression

argument_list ::= argument { "," argument }
argument      ::= [ identifier ":" ] expression (* e.g., `x` or `label: x` *)

(* --- Top-Level Declarations --- *)

program ::= { top_level_declaration }

top_level_declaration ::= import_statement
                        | function_declaration

enum_variant   ::= identifier [ "(" type { "," type } ")" ]

function_declaration ::= [ "///" (* doc... *) ] [ "pub" ] [ "async" ] "fn" identifier "(" [ parameter_list ] ")" [ "->" type ] block_statement
parameter_list       ::= parameter { "," parameter }
parameter            ::= ( "mut" "self" | "self" )
                       | [ "_" ] identifier ":" type [ "=" expression ] (* for default values *)

impl_block ::= "impl" identifier "{" { function_declaration } "}"
