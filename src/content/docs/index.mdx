## What is Boba Lang?

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="A Fresh Take on Productivity âš¡">
    Boba is a modern interpreted language designed for developers who value both speed and safety. Get the rapid feedback loop of an interpreter without sacrificing the security of a strong, static type system.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Built for Tomorrow's Workflow ðŸš€">
    Boba is engineered for the future of development. Its clean grammar, static types, and familiar C-style syntax create a predictable structure that's ideal for Large Language Models to generate and analyze. This clarity makes it easy for humans to verify and improve upon.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Portable by Design ðŸ“¦">
    The Boba toolchain is a single, high-performance native executable. Write your Boba scripts and run them consistently across Windows, macOS, and Linux. There are no other runtimes or dependencies to installâ€”just one portable tool to power your development.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Under Construction ðŸš§">
    Boba is a work in progress and is not generally available *yet*! Stay tuned to my <a href="https://solivan.dev">blog</a> for posts about it.
