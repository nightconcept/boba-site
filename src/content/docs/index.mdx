## What is Boba Lang?

Boba Lang is a statically typed programming language that can be run with an interpreter or compiled for Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms. Itâ€™s designed with a C/Python-like syntax and is aimed at professional developers who are often frustrated by the challenging virtual environments and fragmented tooling ecosystems of other popular languages. To solve this, Boba is engineered to provide a superior developer experience through a cohesive, "batteries-included" toolchain.
