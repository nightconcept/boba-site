title: "Chapter 8: Structuring a Project: Modules & Imports"
description: "Learn how to organize your Boba code into multiple files and share code between them using the `import` keyword."
---

As your programs grow larger, it becomes important to organize your code into multiple files. Boba allows you to do this using modules and the `import` keyword.

By default, all items you define in a file—functions, structs, etc.—are private, meaning they can only be used within that same file. To make an item part of a file's public API so it can be imported elsewhere, you must mark it with the `pub` keyword.

## Importing from Other Files

You can import public functions, structs, enums, and other declarations from other Boba files. This allows you to break your code into logical modules and reuse code across your project.

## Importing Specific Items

To import specific items from a file, you list them by name inside curly braces `{}`, and can optionally rename them with `as`.

```boba
// in utils.boba
pub fn say_hello() {
    print("Hello!")
}
pub fn say_goodbye() {
    print("Goodbye!")
}

// in main.boba
import { say_hello, say_goodbye as farewell } from "./utils.boba"

say_hello() // Prints "Hello!"
farewell() // Prints "Goodbye!"
```

## Importing Everything as a Namespace

To import everything from a file as a single namespace, you can use the `* as <name>` syntax.

```boba
// in utils.boba
pub fn say_hello() { /* ... */ }
pub fn say_goodbye() { /* ... */ }

// in main.boba
import * as utils from "./utils.boba"

utils.say_hello()
utils.say_goodbye()
```

## A Note on Paths

Import paths are always relative to the current file.

## Chapter Summary

- Use the `pub` keyword to make items in a file (functions, structs, etc.) public and importable.
- Use `import { item1, item2 as alias } from "./path/to/file.boba"` to import and optionally rename specific items.
- Use `import * as namespace from "./path/to/file.boba"` to import all public items from a file under a single namespace.
