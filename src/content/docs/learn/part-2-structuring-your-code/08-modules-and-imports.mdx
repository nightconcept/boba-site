---

As your programs grow larger, it becomes important to organize your code into multiple files. Boba allows you to do this using modules and the `import` keyword.

By default, all items (functions, structs, etc.) are private, meaning they can only be accessed from within the same file. To make an item accessible from other files, you must use the `pub` keyword.

## Importing from Other Files

You can import public functions, structs, enums, and other declarations from other Boba files. This allows you to break your code into logical modules and reuse code across your project.

### Importing Specific Items

To import specific items from a file, you list them by name.

```boba
// in utils.boba
pub fn sayHello() {
  print("Hello!")
}

// in main.boba
import sayHello from "./utils.boba"

sayHello() // Prints "Hello!"
```

### Importing Everything

To import everything from a file, you can use the `*` wildcard.

```boba
// in utils.boba
pub fn sayHello() { ... }
pub fn sayGoodbye() { ... }

// in main.boba
import * from "./utils.boba"

sayHello()
sayGoodbye()
```

### Renaming Imports

You can rename an imported item using the `as` keyword. This is useful to avoid naming conflicts.

```boba
// in utils.boba
pub fn sayHello() { ... }

// in main.boba
import sayHello as greet from "./utils.boba"

greet() // Prints "Hello!"
```

## A Note on Paths

Import paths are always relative to the current file.
