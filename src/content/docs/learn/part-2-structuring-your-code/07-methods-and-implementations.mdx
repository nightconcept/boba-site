In the last chapter, we learned how to group data using `structs`. Now, let's give them behavior by implementing functions on them, called **methods**. We do this using an `impl` (implementation) block.

### Defining an `impl` Block

The `impl` block is where you define all the functions that belong to a `struct`.

```boba
struct Player {
  name: string,
  health: int
}

impl Player {
  /// A method that prints the player's status.
  /// The `self` parameter gives us read-only access to the instance.
  pub fn print_status(self) {
    print("{self.name}'s health is {self.health}.")
  }
}
```

### Creating Instances: The `new()` Convention

To create an instance of a struct with behavior, the Boba convention is to create an associated function inside the `impl` block, typically named `new`. This acts as our constructor.

### Modifying State with `mut self`

By default, `self` is immutable. If a method needs to _change_ the struct's data, you must mark the parameter as `mut self`. This is an explicit signal that the method has side effects on the instance.

```boba
impl Player {
    /// Creates a new Player with default health.
    pub fn new(name: string) -> Player {
        return Player{
            name: name,
            health: 100
        }
    }

    /// A method that prints the player's status.
    pub fn print_status(self) {
        print("{self.name}'s health is {self.health}.")
    }

    /// Reduces the player's health by a given amount.
    pub fn take_damage(self: mut Player, amount: int) {
        self.health -= amount
        print("{self.name} takes {amount} damage!")
    }
}
```

Now we can create a `Player` like this:

```boba
let player1 = Player.new("Ada")
player1.print_status() // Outputs: Ada's health is 100.
```

To call a mutating method, the variable holding the struct instance must also be declared with `var`.

```boba
var player2 = Player.new("Boba")
player2.take_damage(25) // This is allowed because player2 is mutable.
player2.print_status()  // Outputs: Boba's health is 75.
