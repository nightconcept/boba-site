In Boba, immutability is the default to promote safer, more predictable code. Mutability must be an explicit choice.

### `let`: Immutable Bindings

The `let` keyword declares an **immutable binding**. Once a value is assigned, it cannot be changed. This should be your default choice for all variables, as it prevents accidental modification and makes code easier to reason about.

```boba
// Immutable binding, this is the preferred default.
let message = "Hello, Boba!"

// This would be a COMPILE ERROR:
// message = "Hello again!"
```

By using `let` wherever possible, you are telling other programmers (and the compiler) that this value is not intended to change.

### `var`: Mutable Variables

The `var` keyword declares a **mutable variable**. You should only use `var` when you have a specific reason to change a value after it has been initialized.

```boba
// Mutable variable, used when mutation is necessary.
var counter = 0
counter = counter + 1 // This is allowed.
```

### `const`: Compile-Time Constants

The `const` keyword is reserved for values that are known at compile-time. These are typically used for universal constants within your program.

```boba
const MAX_HEALTH = 100
```

By defaulting to `let`, you make your code's intent clearer and safer. Now, let's explore the different types of data you can work with.
