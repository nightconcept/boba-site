In Boba, you can store data in variables. A core principle of the language is **immutability by default**, which helps you write safer, more predictable code.

### `let`: Immutable Bindings

The `let` keyword declares an **immutable binding**. Once a value is assigned, it cannot be changed. This should be your default choice for everything, as it prevents accidental modification.
```boba
// An immutable binding for a regular variable.
let message = "Hello, Boba!"
```
// This would be a COMPILE ERROR: // message = "Hello again!"

### Convention: Using `let` for Constants
For universal, program-wide constants, we still use `let`, but we adopt the widely-used `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` naming convention. This signals to other developers that the value has a special, constant role.

```boba
let MAX_HEALTH = 100
let PI = 3.14159
```

### `var`: Mutable Variables

You should only use the `var` keyword when you have a specific and necessary reason to change a value after it's been created.

```boba
// A mutable variable, used only when mutation is required.
var counter = 0
counter = counter + 1 // This is allowed.
```

By defaulting to `let` for everything, you make your code's intent clearer and safer.
