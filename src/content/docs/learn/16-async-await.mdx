Asynchronous programming is essential for building responsive and efficient applications, especially when dealing with tasks like network requests or file I/O that can take time. Boba makes writing asynchronous, non-blocking code as easy and readable as traditional, synchronous code.

## The `async` and `await` Keywords

Boba's concurrency model is built around two keywords: `async` and `await`.

-   **`async`**: A keyword that modifies a function declaration (`async fn ...`). An `async` function does not block when called. Its return type is implicitly wrapped in a `Future<T>`.
-   **`await`**: An operator that can only be used inside an `async` function. It pauses the execution of the async function until the `Future` it is waiting on has completed.

## The Power of Composition: `await` with `?`

Things get really powerful when an `async` function can also fail, returning a `Result`. Boba lets you compose `await` and the `?` operator to handle both asynchrony and errors in a single, clean expression.

```boba
// This async function can fail, so it returns a Result.
async fn fetch_user(id: int) -> Result<User, error> { /* ... */ }

// Note the `?` after await!
let user = await fetch_user(user_id: user_id)?
```
This one line does two things:

- It `await`s the `Future` to complete.
- If the result is an `Err`, the `?` operator propagates it immediately. If it's `Ok`, it unwraps the `User` value and assigns it to the variable.

This elegant composition is key to writing robust, readable asynchronous Boba code.
