---

Asynchronous programming is essential for building responsive and efficient applications, especially when dealing with tasks like network requests or file I/O that can take time. Boba makes writing asynchronous, non-blocking code as easy and readable as traditional, synchronous code.

## The `async` and `await` Keywords

Boba's concurrency model is built around two keywords: `async` and `await`.

-   **`async`**: A keyword that modifies a function declaration (`async fn ...`). An `async` function does not block when called. Its return type is implicitly wrapped in a `Future<T>`. A **`Future`** is a placeholder object that represents a computation that hasn't finished yet. It's a promise that a value of type `T` will be available at some point in the future.
-   **`await`**: An operator that can only be used inside an `async` function. It pauses the execution of the async function until the `Future` it is waiting on has completed.

## A Simple Async Example

To understand the core mechanic of `async`/`await`, let's look at a complete example that doesn't involve errors. We'll simulate a network request that takes some time to complete.

```boba
// This async function simulates fetching data from a server.
// Assume `sleep` is a built-in function from a `time` module.
async fn fetch_greeting() -> string {
  // In a real app, this would be a network call.
  // Here, we'll just pretend it takes a moment.
  sleep(1000) // Pauses for 1000 milliseconds
  return "Hello from the server!"
}

// The main entry point of our program must also be async
// so that we can use the `await` keyword inside it.
async fn main() {
  print("Requesting greeting...")
  // We `await` the result of the async function.
  // Our program pauses here until fetch_greeting() is done.
  let greeting = await fetch_greeting()
  print(f"Received: {greeting}")
}
```

When you run this, you'll see "Requesting greeting...", a one-second pause, and then "Received: Hello from the server!". This shows the fundamental flow: calling an `async` function gives you a future, and `await`ing it pauses your current function to get the result.

> **What is an Async Runtime?**
>
> You might be wondering what is actually scheduling and running these `async` functions. Boba includes a built-in **async runtime**. This is a part of the language's standard library that manages a pool of threads and knows how to efficiently run thousands of `async` tasks, pausing them when they are waiting (like for our `sleep` or a real network call) and resuming them when they are ready to make progress. You don't need to configure or manage it; you can just write `async` code and Boba handles the rest.

## The Power of Composition: `await` with `?`

Now that you understand the basics of `async` and `await`, we can combine this knowledge with what you learned about error handling. Things get really powerful when an `async` function can also fail, returning a `Result`. Boba lets you compose `await` and the `?` operator to handle both asynchrony and errors in a single, clean expression.

```boba
// This async function can fail, so it returns a Result.
// Assume `User` and `error` are structs you have defined elsewhere.
async fn fetch_user(id: int) -> Result<User, error> { /* ... */ }

// Note the `?` after await!
let user = await fetch_user(user_id: user_id)?
```
This one line does two things in a specific order. First, the `await` keyword acts, pausing the function until the `Future<Result<...>>` is resolved into a plain `Result<...>` value. Only then does the `?` operator inspect that `Result`:

- If the result is an `Err`, the `?` operator propagates it immediately.
- If it's `Ok`, it unwraps the `User` value and assigns it to the variable.

This elegant composition is key to writing robust, readable asynchronous Boba code.

### Time to Practice!

You're ready to tackle asynchronous tasks. The next exercises will prompt you to convert synchronous functions to be `async` and to use `await` to retrieve their results, preparing you for real-world I/O tasks.

### Running Futures Concurrently

While `await` is great for waiting on a single result, the true power of async is unlocked when you run multiple operations at the same time. Boba provides a way to await multiple futures concurrently. For example, a `Future.all()` function would take a list of futures and return a single new future that completes when all of the input futures have completed.

```boba
async fn get_user_data() -> string {
    // Simulate a slow DB call
    timer.sleep(ms: 100)
    return "User Data"
}

async fn get_app_settings() -> string {
    // Simulate another slow network call
    timer.sleep(ms: 150)
    return "App Settings"
}

async fn main() {
    print("Fetching data concurrently...")
    let results = await Future.all([
        get_user_data(),
        get_app_settings(),
    ])
    // This block only runs after BOTH functions are complete.
    // The total time elapsed will be ~150ms, not 250ms.
    print(f"Results: {results}") // e.g., Results: ["User Data", "App Settings"]
}
```
