title: "Chapter 18: Writing Professional Code: Idiomatic Boba"
description: "Learn the official Boba code style, documentation standards, and the philosophy behind them."
---

Welcome to the final step in your learning journey: moving from writing code that works to writing code that is truly idiomatic. Idiomatic code is clear, maintainable, and leverages the language's strengths in the way its designers intended.

## Naming Conventions

Consistent naming makes code predictable.

- **`PascalCase` for Types:** All `struct` and `enum` types.
  - `struct PlayerProfile`, `enum RequestStatus`
- **`snake_case` for Values:** All functions, methods, and variables.
  - `fn get_user_data`, `let current_score`, `var remaining_attempts`
- **`SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for Constants:** Global or module-level constants declared with `let`.
  - `let MAX_CONNECTIONS = 100`

## Formatting (`boba fmt`)

The `boba fmt` tool handles formatting automatically, ensuring all code in the ecosystem is instantly familiar. Having one official formatting tool eliminates all arguments over code style. It ensures that any Boba code a developer encounters will be instantly familiar, reducing the cognitive load of reading and contributing to new projects.

## BobaDoc: The Standardized Documentation Engine

Good code is well-documented. Boba has a built-in standard for documentation called BobaDoc, which is designed to be easy to write, human-readable, and machine-parsable.

-   **`///` (Outer Comment):** Documents the single item immediately following it.
-   **`//!` (Inner Comment):** Documents the item that contains it, most often used at the very top of a file to document the entire module.

BobaDoc uses simple `@` tags for structured data:

-   `@param name: description` - Describes a parameter.
-   `@returns: description` - Describes the return value.
-   `@panics: description` - Describes conditions that will cause a panic.
-   `@example:` - Marks a following code block as an example.

Code within `@example` blocks can be automatically tested by running the `boba test --doc` command, ensuring documentation is always accurate.

```boba
//! A module for safe file system operations.

/// Reads an entire file into a string.
///
/// This function handles opening, reading, and closing the file. It is the
/// primary, safe way to get the contents of a file.
///
/// @param path: The string path to the file to be read.
/// @returns: A `Result` containing the file's contents as a `string` on success,
///          or an `Error` if the file cannot be found or read.
/// @example:
///   var content = read_file("my_file.txt")?
pub fn read_file(path: string) -> Result<string, Error> {
    // ... implementation ...
}
```

## Comments vs. Documentation

- Use BobaDoc (`///`) to explain the *what* and *how* for users of your API. This is for the public interface.
- Use inline comments (`//`) to explain the *why* for maintainers of your code. Explain complex logic, non-obvious choices, or the reasoning behind a particular algorithm.

## What's Next?

Congratulations on completing this foundational tour of the Boba language! You've taken a significant step from writing your first "Hello, world!" to understanding the principles of idiomatic, professional Boba code.

You have mastered the core concepts of the language, including variables, control flow, functions, and custom `struct` types. More importantly, you've learned about the features that make Boba robust and safe, such as the `Option` and `Result` types for explicit error handling and the powerful built-in testing framework for verifying your code's correctness.

Your journey doesn't end here. To continue growing as a Boba developer, we encourage you to explore the following steps:

-   **Explore the official Boba Standard Library documentation.** Familiarize yourself with the rich set of tools and modules available to you.
-   **Build a small, complete project from scratch.** Apply what you've learned to create something new, like a command-line tool or a simple web server.
-   **Read through the source code of idiomatic Boba projects.** Learning from experienced developers is one of the fastest ways to deepen your understanding of best practices.
-   **Join the community.** A programming language is its ecosystem and its community. Join our Discord server or forums to ask questions, share what you've learned, and connect with other Boba developers.
