Functions are blocks of code that you can name and call from other parts of your program. They are essential for organizing your code and making it reusable.

## Defining and Calling Functions

You define a function using the `fn` keyword. You can also specify the types of the arguments and the return value.

```boba
// A simple function that takes no arguments and returns nothing.
pub fn sayHello() -> void {
  print("Hello, Boba!")
}

// Call the function
sayHello()
```

### Functions with Arguments and Return Values

Functions can take input values (arguments) and produce an output value (return value).

```boba
pub fn add(a: number, b: number) -> number {
  return a + b
}

var sum = add(5, 3) // sum will be 8
```

### Private Functions

By default, functions are private, meaning they can only be called from within the same file. To make a function accessible from other files, you must use the `pub` keyword. The `pub` keyword makes your functions available to other files, a concept we'll explore in the final chapter on Imports.

```boba
// This function can only be called from this file.
fn myPrivateFunction() -> void {
  print("This is a secret!")
}
```

## Default Parameters

Boba allows you to provide default values for function parameters. This makes the function more flexible, as you can call it with fewer arguments.

```boba
pub fn connect(host: string, port: number = 5432, use_ssl: boolean = true) {
  // ... connection logic ...
}

// Call with all arguments
connect("myhost.com", 8080, false)

// Call with only the required argument
connect("myhost.com")
```

## The Pipe Operator `|>`

Boba supports the pipe operator `|>` for chaining function calls in a more readable way. The result of one function is passed as the first argument to the next function.

```boba
var ingredients: string[] = ["flour", "sugar", "boba pearls"]

ingredients[0] |> upper() |> print() // Outputs "FLOUR"
```

Functions are the building blocks of any Boba program. In the next chapter, we'll explore how to group related data together using structs.
