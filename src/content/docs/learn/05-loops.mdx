Loops are used to execute a block of code multiple times. Boba provides two primary loops: `for` for iterating over sequences and `while` for looping as long as a condition is true.

#### The `for` Loop: The Main Iteration Tool

The `for` loop is Boba's most powerful and common loop. It can iterate over a collection of items or a range of numbers.

**1. Iterating Over Collections** This is the idiomatic way to work with every item in a `list` or `map`.

```boba
let ingredients: string[] = ["healing potion", "sword", "shield"]

// The `for...in` loop will go through each item in the list.
for item in ingredients {
  print(f"Player inventory contains: {item}")
}
```

**2. Iterating Over a Range of Numbers** To repeat an action a specific number of times, you can use a range. A range is created with the `..` (exclusive) or `..=` (inclusive) operator. A range is a temporary sequence of numbers created on-the-fly, specifically for the purpose of iteration.

```boba
// A range from 0 up to, but not including, 5 (0, 1, 2, 3, 4).
// This will run 5 times.
for i in 0..5 {
  print(f"Executing task {i}...")
}

// An inclusive range from 1 up to, and including, 3.
for i in 1..=3 {
  print(f"This is message number {i}.")
}
// Output:
// This is message number 1.
// This is message number 2.
// This is message number 3.
```

**3. Iterating Over a Map's Key-Value Pairs**

To iterate over a map, you can use the `.items()` method to get both the key and the value for each entry.

```boba
let player_skills = {"archery": 5, "magic": 3}

for key, value in player_skills.items() {
  print(f"Skill: {key}, Level: {value}")
}
```

#### The `while` Loop

The while loop continues to execute a block of code as long as a specified condition remains true. You should use a while loop when you don't know ahead of time how many times you need to loop.
```boba
var countdown = 3

    // Loop as long as countdown is greater than 0.
    while countdown > 0 {
    print(f"{countdown}...")
    countdown = countdown - 1 // Decrement the counter.
    }

    print("Liftoff!")
    // Output:
    // 3...
    // 2...
    // 1...
    // Liftoff!
```

> **A Word of Caution**
> Since a `while` loop's continuation depends on a condition you manage manually, you are responsible for ensuring the condition will eventually become `false` to prevent an infinite loop.

> #### **Time to Practice!**

> Iteration is fundamental to programming. Your next exercises will have you using `for` and `while` loops to process collections and repeat actions, solidifying your understanding of how to control program flow.
