Loops are used to execute a block of code multiple times. Boba provides several types of loops to handle different situations.

## The `for` Loop

The `for` loop is ideal when you want to repeat a block of code a specific number of times.

```boba
// This loop will print numbers from 1 to 5
for i in 1 to 5 by 1 {
  print("I am print {i}!")
}
```

## The `while` Loop

The `while` loop continues to execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is `true`.

```boba
var j: number = 0
while j < 10 {
  j++
  print("I am print {j}!")
  if j == 5 then break // `break` exits the loop
}
```

## The `foreach` Loop

The `foreach` loop is used to iterate over the elements of a list or map.

```boba
var ingredients: string[] = ["flour", "sugar", "boba pearls"]

foreach ingredient in ingredients {
  print("We need {ingredient}.")
}
```

## The `repeat` Loop

The `repeat` loop is similar to a `while` loop, but the condition is checked at the end of the loop. This means the loop will always execute at least once.

```boba
var k: number = 0
repeat {
  print("Repeating!")
  k++
} until k == 10
```

Loops are a powerful tool for automating repetitive tasks. In the next chapter, we'll learn how to organize our code into reusable blocks called functions.
