Structs, short for structures, are custom data types you can create by grouping together related variables. Think of a struct definition as a blueprint: it defines the shape and fields for a concept in your program. From that blueprint, you can then create multiple concrete instances.

## Defining a Struct

You define a struct using the `struct` keyword. Inside the struct definition, you list the variables (called fields) that make up the struct.

```boba
// Define a `Player` struct
struct Player {
  name: string,
  score: int,
  is_active: boolean
}
```

## Creating an Instance of a Struct

Once you have defined a struct, you can create instances of it using a struct literal.

```boba
// Create a new variable `ada` of type `Player`
let ada: Player = { name: "Ada", score: 100, is_active: true }
```

## Accessing Struct Fields

You can access the fields of a struct instance using dot notation.

```boba
print(f"Player name: {ada.name}") // Prints "Player name: Ada"
```

### Field Visibility and the `pub` Keyword

By default, all fields in a struct are **private**. This means they can only be accessed by code in the same file where the struct is defined. This is a core principle of encapsulation, preventing external code from relying on the internal structure of your data.

To make a field part of the struct's public API, you must explicitly mark it with the `pub` keyword.

Think of it like a building: some rooms (private fields) are for internal staff only, while the reception area (`pub` fields) is accessible to the public.

This principle of encapsulation allows the author of a struct to later refactor or change the internal, private fields without breaking the code of users who depend on it, as long as the public API (the `pub` fields) remains consistent.

```boba
// in a file named `user.boba`

pub struct User {
  pub id: int,      // This field is public and can be accessed from other files.
  username: string, // This field is private to `user.boba`.
  email: string,    // This is also private.
}
```

If you tried to access `some_user.username` from a different file, the compiler would stop you, enforcing the privacy rules you've defined.
### Mutating a Struct
To create a mutable instance whose fields you can modify, you must declare the variable using `var`. If a struct instance is bound using `let`, it is deeply immutableâ€”neither the variable can be reassigned, nor can its fields be changed.
```boba
// Create a mutable Player instance
var boba_dev: Player = { name: "Boba Dev", score: 0, is_active: false }
print(f"Initial score: {boba_dev.score}") // Outputs: Initial score: 0

// Mutate the score field
boba_dev.score = 150
print(f"Updated score: {boba_dev.score}") // Outputs: Updated score: 150
```

### Time to Practice!

You now know how to bundle related data together. This is the first half of creating powerful custom types. In the next chapter, we will bring this data to life by giving our structs behavior with methods.
