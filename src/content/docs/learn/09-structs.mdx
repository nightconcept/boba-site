Structs, short for structures, allow you to create your own custom data types by grouping together related variables. This is a powerful way to organize and manage complex data in your programs.

## Defining a Struct

You define a struct using the `struct` keyword. Inside the struct definition, you list the variables (called fields) that make up the struct.

```boba
// Define a `Player` struct
struct Player {
name: string,
score: int,
is_active: boolean
}
```

## Creating an Instance of a Struct

Once you have defined a struct, you can create instances of it using a struct literal.

```boba
// Create a new variable `ada` of type `Player`
let ada: Player = { name: "Ada", score: 100, is_active: true }
```

## Accessing Struct Fields

You can access the fields of a struct instance using dot notation.

```boba
print("Player name: {ada.name}") // Prints "Player name: Ada"
```

Structs are perfect for organizing data. In the next chapter, we'll learn how to give our structs behavior by adding functions directly to them.
