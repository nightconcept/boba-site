Loops are used to execute a block of code multiple times. Boba provides two primary loops: `for` for iterating over sequences and `while` for looping as long as a condition is true.

#### The `for` Loop: The Main Iteration Tool

The `for` loop is Boba's most powerful and common loop. It can iterate over a collection of items or a range of numbers.

**1. Iterating Over Collections** This is the idiomatic way to work with every item in a `list` or `map`.

```boba
let ingredients: string[] = ["healing potion", "sword", "shield"]

// The `for...in` loop will go through each item in the list.
for item in ingredients {
  print(f"Player inventory contains: {item}")
}
```

**2. Iterating Over a Range of Numbers** To repeat an action a specific number of times, you can use a range. A range is created with the `..` (exclusive) or `..=` (inclusive) operator.

```boba
// A range from 0 up to, but not including, 5 (0, 1, 2, 3, 4).
// This will run 5 times.
for i in 0..5 {
  print(f"Executing task {i}...")
}

// An inclusive range from 1 up to, and including, 5 (1, 2, 3, 4, 5).
for i in 1..=5 {
  player.take_poison_damage(amount: 2)
  print(f"Poison damage tick {i}. Player health is now {player.health}.")
}
```

#### The `while` Loop

The `while` loop continues to execute a block of code as long as a specified condition remains `true`.

```boba
var player_mana: int = 100

// Regenerate mana until it is full.
while player_mana < 100 {
  player_mana += 5 // Using the earmarked compound assignment for example
  print(f"Regenerating... mana is now {player_mana}.")
  timer.sleep(ms: 500) // Assuming a standard library timer
}

print("Mana is full!")
