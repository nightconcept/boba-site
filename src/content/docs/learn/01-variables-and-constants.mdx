Welcome to Boba! Let's start with the fundamentals: how to store and manage data in your programs. In Boba, you have two ways to do this: variables and constants.

## Variables

Variables are used to store values that can change. You declare a variable using the `var` keyword.

```boba
// Declare a variable `score` of type `number` and initialize it to 100.
var score: number = 100

// You can change the value of a variable.
score = 120
```

### Type Inference

Boba is a smart language! If you don't explicitly specify the type of a variable, Boba will infer it from the value you assign.

```boba
// Boba infers that `health` is a `number`.
var health = 100

// Boba infers that `playerName` is a `string`.
var playerName = "Boba Fett"
```

### Multiple Declarations

You can declare multiple variables of the same type on a single line.

```boba
var x, y, z: number = 1, 2, 3
```

## Constants

Constants are used to store values that will not change. You declare a constant using the `const` keyword.

```boba
const MAX_PLAYERS: number = 4
```

Once a constant is declared, you cannot change its value. This is useful for values that should remain constant throughout your program, like a configuration value or a mathematical constant.

```boba
const PI: number = 3.14159

// This would cause a compile error:
// PI = 3.14
```

## Built-in Constants

Boba provides a few built-in constants for convenience:

- `true`: A boolean value representing truth.
- `false`: A boolean value representing falsehood.

Now that you know how to create variables and constants, let's move on to the different types of data you can store in them.
