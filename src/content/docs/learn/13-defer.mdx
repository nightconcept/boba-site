Welcome to the next step in your Boba journey! We've seen how to handle potential problems with `Result` and `?`. Now, let's learn how to make sure our program always cleans up after itself, no matter what happens.

## The Problem: Forgetting to Clean Up

Imagine you're working with a file. You need to open it, read some data, and then—most importantly—close it. If you don't close the file, you can cause problems like resource leaks.

This gets tricky when your function has multiple ways to exit.

```boba
pub fn process_file(path: string) -> Result<string, error> {
    var file = fs.open(path)?

    var data = file.read_all()?
    if (data.is_empty()) {
        file.close() // We have to close it here...
        return Err({ message = "File is empty" })
    }

    file.close() // ...and we have to close it here too.
    return Ok("Processed data!")
}
```

It's easy to forget one of those `file.close()` calls, leading to bugs.

## The Solution: `defer`

Boba provides a simple and powerful keyword to solve this: `defer`.

The `defer` statement schedules a function call to be executed right before the current function exits. It doesn't matter *how* the function exits—whether by a `return`, by reaching the end, or by propagating an error with `?`.

Let's rewrite our example using `defer`:

```boba
pub fn process_file(path: string) -> Result<string, error> {
    // 1. Open the file. If this fails, we exit, no cleanup needed.
    var file = fs.open(path)?

    // 2. Defer the close call *immediately* after opening.
    // This is now GUARANTEED to run when process_file exits.
    defer file.close()

    // 3. Now, we can focus on the logic without worrying about cleanup.
    var data = file.read_all()?
    if (data.is_empty()) {
        // We can just return. `defer file.close()` will run automatically.
        return Err({ message = "File is empty" })
    }

    // `defer file.close()` will also run automatically before this return.
    return Ok("Processed data!")
}
```

By placing `defer file.close()` right after `fs.open(path)?`, we make our code cleaner, safer, and easier to read. The cleanup code is right next to the resource it's cleaning up.

Now that you've mastered writing robust Boba code, let's move on to object-oriented programming with classes in the next chapter.
