Welcome to Boba! The best way to start learning any new programming language is to write a program. Let's write one that prints the classic message: "Hello, world!".

#### Step 1: Create Your File

First, create a new file named `hello.boba`.

#### Step 2: Write the Code

Open `hello.boba` in your favorite text editor and type the following single line of code:
```boba
print("Hello, world!")
```

This line uses Boba's built-in `print()` function to display text, called a `string`, to your console.

#### Step 3: Run Your Program

Now, open your terminal, navigate to the directory where you saved `hello.boba`, and run the following command:
```sh
boba run hello.boba
```

The `boba` command-line tool will compile and execute your file.

#### Step 4: See the Output!

You should see the following output in your terminal:
```plaintext
Hello, world!
```

**Congratulations!** You have just written and run your very first Boba program. You've already used a built-in function (`print`) and a data type (`string`) without even thinking about it.
