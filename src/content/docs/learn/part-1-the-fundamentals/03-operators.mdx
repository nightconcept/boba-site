Now that you know about variables and data types, let's look at how to manipulate them using operators. Operators are special symbols that perform operations on your data.

## Arithmetic Operators

Boba provides a standard set of arithmetic operators for performing mathematical calculations.

| Operator | Description      | Example                |
| :------- | :--------------- | :--------------------- |
| `+`      | Addition         | `5 + 2` results in `7`   |
| `-`      | Subtraction      | `5 - 2` results in `3`   |
| `*`      | Multiplication   | `5 * 2` results in `10`  |
| `/`      | Division         | `5 / 2` results in `2.5` |
| `%`      | Modulo (remainder) | `5 % 2` results in `1`   |
| `^`      | Power (Note: some languages like Python and JavaScript use `**` for this) | `5 ^ 2` results in `25`  |

##### Compound Assignment Operators

> To modify a variable in-place, Boba provides a convenient shorthand: compound assignment operators. They combine an arithmetic or bitwise operation with an assignment.

```boba
var score: int = 100
// Instead of: score = score + 25
score += 25 // score is now 125

var mana: int = 50
mana -= 10 // mana is now 40

var base_damage = 10
base_damage *= 2 // base_damage is now 20
```

### Numeric Operations and Conversions

When you mix integer (`int`) and floating-point (`float`) numbers, Boba follows simple rules to keep things predictable.

1.  **Mixed-Type Math**: If you perform math (`+`, `-`, `*`) between an `int` and a `float`, the result is always a `float`.
    -   `10 (int) + 2.5 (float)` results in `12.5 (float)`.

2.  **Division Always Returns a Float**: The division operator `/` always produces a `float` to avoid bugs where whole number division gives unexpected results.
    -   `5 (int) / 2 (int)` results in `2.5 (float)`.

3.  **Explicit Conversion**: To turn a `float` into an `int`, you must be explicit with the `as` keyword, which truncates the decimal.
    -   `let my_float: float = 9.9; let my_int = my_float as int; // my_int is 9`

## Comparison Operators

Comparison operators are used to compare two values. They always result in a `boolean` (`true` or `false`) value.

| Operator | Description          | Example               |
| :------- | :------------------- | :-------------------- |
| `==`     | Equal to             | `5 == 5` is `true`    |
| `!=`     | Not equal to         | `5 != 5` is `false`   |
| `<`      | Less than            | `5 < 8` is `true`     |
| `>`      | Greater than         | `5 > 8` is `false`    |
| `<=`     | Less than or equal   | `5 <= 5` is `true`    |
| `>=`     | Greater than or equal| `5 >= 8` is `false`   |

##### Checking for Containment with `in`

> To check if an element exists within a `list`, `map`, or `string`, you can use the highly readable `in` operator.

```boba
let inventory: string[] = ["sword", "shield", "potion"]

// Check if "shield" is in our inventory list.
if "shield" in inventory {
  print("You are well-defended!")
}

let player_skills = {"archery": 5, "magic": 3}

// For maps, `in` checks if the key exists.
if "stealth" in player_skills {
  print("You can sneak.")
} else {
  print("You are not a sneaky person.") // This will print.
}
```

## Logical Operators

Logical operators are used to combine boolean values.

| Operator | Description | Example                               |
| :------- | :---------- | :------------------------------------ |
| `and`    | Logical AND | `true and false` results in `false` |
| `or`     | Logical OR  | `true or false` results in `true`   |
| `not`    | Logical NOT | `not true` results in `false`       |

```boba
var hasKey = true
var isDoorLocked = false

if hasKey and not isDoorLocked {
  print("You can open the door!")
}
```

## Bitwise Operators (Advanced)

Bitwise operators are used to perform operations on individual bits of a number. This is an advanced topic, but it's good to know they exist.
