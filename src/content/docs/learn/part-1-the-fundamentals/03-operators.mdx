Now that you know about variables and data types, let's look at how to manipulate them using operators. Operators are special symbols that perform operations on your data.

## Arithmetic Operators

Boba provides a standard set of arithmetic operators for performing mathematical calculations.

| Operator | Description      | Example                |
| :------- | :--------------- | :--------------------- |
| `+`      | Addition         | `5 + 2` results in `7`   |
| `-`      | Subtraction      | `5 - 2` results in `3`   |
| `*`      | Multiplication   | `5 * 2` results in `10`  |
| `/`      | Division         | `5 / 2` results in `2.5` |
| `%`      | Modulo (remainder) | `5 % 2` results in `1`   |
| `^`      | Power (Note: some languages like Python and JavaScript use `**` for this) | `5 ^ 2` results in `25`  |

##### Compound Assignment Operators

> To modify a variable in-place, Boba provides a convenient shorthand: compound assignment operators. They combine an arithmetic or bitwise operation with an assignment.

```boba
var score: int = 100
// Instead of: score = score + 25
score += 25 // score is now 125

var mana: int = 50
mana -= 10 // mana is now 40

var base_damage = 10
base_damage *= 2 // base_damage is now 20
```

Boba's operators follow a standard order of operations, often remembered by acronyms like PEMDAS or BODMAS. For example, multiplication and division are performed before addition and subtraction. When in doubt, or to make your code clearer for other readers, always use parentheses `()` to group operations and ensure they are evaluated in the order you intend.

### Numeric Operations and Conversions

When you mix integer (`int`) and floating-point (`float`) numbers, Boba follows simple rules to keep things predictable.

1.  **Mixed-Type Math**: If you perform math (`+`, `-`, `*`) between an `int` and a `float`, the result is always a `float`.
    -   `10 (int) + 2.5 (float)` results in `12.5 (float)`.

2.  **Division Always Returns a Float**: The division operator `/` always produces a `float` to avoid bugs where whole number division gives unexpected results.
    -   `5 (int) / 2 (int)` results in `2.5 (float)`.

3.  **Explicit Conversion**: To turn a `float` into an `int`, you must be explicit with the `as` keyword, which truncates the decimal.
    -   `let my_float: float = 9.9; let my_int = my_float as int; // my_int is 9`

## Comparison Operators

Comparison operators are used to compare two values. They always result in a `boolean` (`true` or `false`) value.

| Operator | Description          | Example               |
| :------- | :------------------- | :-------------------- |
| `==`     | Equal to             | `5 == 5` is `true`    |
| `!=`     | Not equal to         | `5 != 5` is `false`   |
| `<`      | Less than            | `5 < 8` is `true`     |
| `>`      | Greater than         | `5 > 8` is `false`    |
| `<=`     | Less than or equal   | `5 <= 5` is `true`    |
| `>=`     | Greater than or equal| `5 >= 8` is `false`   |

##### Checking for Containment with `in`

> To check if an element exists within a `list`, `map`, or `string`, you can use the highly readable `in` operator.

```boba
let inventory: string[] = ["sword", "shield", "potion"]

// Check if "shield" is in our inventory list.
if "shield" in inventory {
  print("You are well-defended!")
}

let player_skills = {"archery": 5, "magic": 3}

// For maps, `in` checks if the key exists.
if "stealth" in player_skills {
  print("You can sneak.")
} else {
  print("You are not a sneaky person.") // This will print.
}
```

##### Explicit Comparisons Required

In Boba, a condition must explicitly evaluate to a boolean. Unlike languages such as JavaScript or Python, you cannot use non-boolean values in a boolean context (sometimes called "truthy" or "falsy" values). This is a safety feature that prevents common bugs.

```boba
// WRONG: This will cause a compile error because 'score' is an integer, not a boolean.
var score: int = 100
// if score { ... }

// RIGHT: The result of the '!=' comparison is a boolean.
if score != 0 {
    print("You have a non-zero score!")
}
```

## Logical Operators

Logical operators are used to combine boolean values.

| Operator | Description | Example                               |
| :------- | :---------- | :------------------------------------ |
| `and`    | Logical AND | `true and false` results in `false` |
| `or`     | Logical OR  | `true or false` results in `true`   |
| `not`    | Logical NOT | `not true` results in `false`       |

```boba
var has_key = true
var is_door_locked = false

if has_key and not is_door_locked {
  print("You can open the door!")
}
```

### Advanced: Working with Bits

While arithmetic operators work on a number's mathematical value, bitwise operators manipulate its individual 1s and 0s (bits). This is an advanced technique used for performance-critical code, data packing, or managing sets of flags efficiently.
A common use-case is for permissions. Imagine each permission is a unique bit:

```boba
let CAN_INVITE: int = 1 // Binary: ...0001
let CAN_KICK:   int = 2 // Binary: ...0010
let CAN_PROMOTE:int = 4 // Binary: ...0100

// Grant permissions with the bitwise OR operator `|`
let permissions = CAN_INVITE | CAN_PROMOTE // ...0101 (value is 5)

// Check for a permission with the bitwise AND operator `&`
if permissions & CAN_PROMOTE != 0 {
    print("This user can promote members.")
}
```
Boba also supports `^` (XOR), `~` (NOT), and shift operators (`<<`, `>>`).
