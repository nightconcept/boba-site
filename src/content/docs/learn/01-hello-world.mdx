Let's get you writing Boba code immediately. Create a file called `hello.boba`:

```boba
fn main() {
    print("Hello, world!")
}
```

Run it:
```sh
boba run hello.boba
```

Output:
```plaintext
Hello, world!
```

## Boba Syntax Basics

Here's what you just wrote:

- `fn main()` - Entry point function (required in all Boba programs)
- `print()` - Built-in function for console output
- Semicolons are optional in Boba
- Curly braces define code blocks

## Boba Program Structure

Every Boba program needs a `main()` function as its entry point. This function tells Boba where to start executing your code. The `print()` function outputs text to the console, and semicolons are optional in Boba - you can include them or leave them out based on your preference.

Boba is a compiled language with static typing, meaning it checks your code for errors before running it. This catches many bugs early in development, making your programs more reliable.
## Quick Experiments

Try these modifications to get familiar with the syntax:

```boba
fn main() {
    print("Hello, world!")
    print("Welcome to Boba!")  // Multiple statements
    print(42)                  // Numbers don't need quotes
    
    // You can also use f-strings for interpolation
    let name = "Developer"
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")
}
```

## Development Workflow

The `boba run` command does several things:
1. Compiles your code to bytecode
2. Checks for type errors
3. Executes the program if compilation succeeds

For faster iteration, you can also use:
```sh
boba check hello.boba  # Just compile and check types
boba build hello.boba  # Compile to executable
```

## Time to Practice!

Before moving on, try these experiments to get comfortable with Boba:

1. **Change the message**: Modify the string to print your name
2. **Add more output**: Include multiple `print()` statements
3. **Try different data types**: Print numbers without quotes: `print(42)`
4. **Use f-strings**: Try `print(f"Hello, {name}!")` with a variable

## What's Next

You've successfully set up Boba and written your first program. Next, you'll learn about variables and Boba's immutability-by-default approach. This design choice prevents many common runtime bugs by making data unchangeable unless you explicitly specify otherwise.
