Welcome to Boba! The best way to start learning any new programming language is to write a program. Let's write one that prints the classic message: "Hello, world!".

### Step 1: Create Your File

First, create a new file named `hello.boba`.

### Step 2: Write the Code

Open `hello.boba` in your favorite text editor and type the following lines of code:
```boba
fn main() {
    print("Hello, world!")
}
```

This line uses Boba's built-in `print()` function to display text. The text inside the double quotes, "Hello, world!", is a `string`—a sequence of text characters. The double quotes (`"`) are crucial syntax that tells Boba where the string begins and ends. The `fn main() { ... }` block defines the main function. This is a special function in Boba that serves as the entry point—it's the very first part of your code that runs. All the code you want to execute must be placed inside its curly braces {}.

### Step 3: Run Your Program

Now, open your terminal, navigate to the directory where you saved `hello.boba`, and run the following command:
```sh
boba run hello.boba
```

The `boba` command is the main entry point to Boba's development tools. The `run` command specifically compiles your code and, if successful, immediately executes the resulting program.

> **Note: Are you in the right directory?**
>
> Your terminal needs to be open to the same folder where you saved `hello.boba`. If you see an error like `file not found`, you can use the `cd` (change directory) command to navigate to the correct location.

#### Step 4: See the Output!

You should see the following output in your terminal:
```plaintext
Hello, world!
```

**Congratulations!** You have just written and run your very first Boba program. You've already used the Boba toolchain (`boba run`), the main function (`fn main`), a built-in function (`print`), and a core data type (`string`).
## Deconstructing "Hello, World"

Let's break down the code you just wrote to understand the fundamental concepts you've already put into practice.

- **`fn main() { ... }` is the Main Function**: A function is a reusable, named block of code. The main function is a special, required function that acts as the starting point for every Boba program. When you run your file, the code inside the main function's curly braces {} is what gets executed.
- **`print()` is a Function**: For example, Boba provides the built-in `print()` function to display output. You "call" a function by writing its name followed by parentheses `()`. You can think of it like a recipe in a cookbook; you "call" the recipe by name to perform the steps within it.
- **`"Hello, world!"` is a String**: The text you see inside the double quotes is a string—Boba's data type for representing text data. The quotes are important; they tell Boba where the string begins and ends, and anything enclosed in them is treated as a single string value by the language.
- **`(...)` are Arguments**: Arguments are the specific pieces of information, or "inputs," that you provide to a function for it to work with. When you call a function, you "pass" arguments to it inside the parentheses. In this case, you passed the string `"Hello, world!"` to the `print()` function so it knew precisely what to display.

Understanding these three ideas—functions, strings, and arguments—is the first major step to mastering Boba.

### Time to Practice!

This is the perfect time to switch to your first set of exercises. They will challenge you to use the `print()` function and manipulate simple strings to solidify what you've just learned.
