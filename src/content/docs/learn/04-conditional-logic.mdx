In programming, you often need to execute different code depending on certain conditions. Boba uses the familiar `if`, `else if`, and `else` keywords to handle conditional logic.

## The `if` Statement

The `if` statement executes a block of code only if a specified condition is `true`.

```boba
var temperature = 30

if (temperature > 25) {
  print("It's a hot day!")
}
```

## The `else` Statement

You can use the `else` statement to provide a block of code to execute if the `if` condition is `false`.

```boba
var score = 85

if (score >= 60) {
  print("You passed!")
} else {
  print("You failed. Better luck next time!")
}
```

## The `else if` Statement

To handle multiple conditions, you can chain `if` statements with `else if`.

```boba
var hunger = "hungry"
var thirst = "thirsty"

if (hunger == "hungry" and thirst == "thirsty") {
  print("You are hungry and thirsty.")
} else if (hunger == "hungry") {
  print("You are only hungry.")
} else if (thirst == "thirsty") {
  print("You are only thirsty.")
} else {
  print("You are neither hungry nor thirsty.")
}
```

Conditional logic is a fundamental part of programming. In the next chapter, we'll look at another crucial concept for controlling program flow: loops.
