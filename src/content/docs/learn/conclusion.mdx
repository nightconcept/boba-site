**Congratulations!** You have completed the Boba language tutorial. You've progressed from writing your first "Hello, world!" to understanding the advanced features that make Boba a safe, clear, and powerful language.

You now have a solid foundation in Boba's core concepts, including:
* **Safety and Robustness:** Using `Option`, `Result`, `defer`, and `panic` to write code that handles errors gracefully and predictably.
* **Clarity and Intent:** Leveraging immutable-by-default design, mandatory named arguments, and a strong type system to make your code's purpose clear.
* **Modern Concurrency:** Writing clean, non-blocking code with `async` and `await`.

Your journey as a Boba developer is just beginning. To continue building your skills, we recommend you:
* **Build a Project:** Try creating a small command-line tool or a simple web server to apply what you've learned.
* **Explore the Standard Library:** Dive into the official documentation to discover the rich set of functions available for lists, maps, strings, and more.
* **Read Idiomatic Code:** Find open-source projects written in Boba and see how experienced developers structure their applications.

Welcome to the community. Happy coding!
