title: "Chapter 11: Structuring Your Project: Modules"
description: "Learn how to organize your Boba code into multiple files and share code between them using the `import` keyword."
---

As your programs grow larger, it becomes important to organize your code into multiple files. In Boba, the module system is designed to be simple and intuitive. The rules are:

1.  **Every file is a module.** Each `.boba` file you create is its own module, a private container for its contents.
2.  **Items are private by default.** All items you define in a file—functions, structs, enums, etc.—are private to that module. They can only be used within the same file.
3.  **Use `pub` to create a public API.** To make an item accessible from other modules, you must explicitly mark it with the `pub` keyword. This makes it part of the module's public API.
4.  **Use `import` to access public items.** The `import` keyword is the mechanism to use public items from one module in another.

This revised structure is more logical. It starts with the container (the file/module), explains the visibility rules within it (private/`pub`), and then explains how to cross the container boundary (`import`). This eliminates repetition and builds the concepts in a more orderly way.

> For the following examples, assume you have two files, `utils.boba` and `main.boba`, located together in the same directory.

## Importing Specific Items

To import specific items from a file, you use the `import { item } from "path"` syntax. You can list items by name inside curly braces `{}`, and can optionally rename them with `as`.

```boba
// in utils.boba
pub fn say_hello() {
    print("Hello!")
}
pub fn say_goodbye() {
    print("Goodbye!")
}

// in main.boba
// The `./` is important! It tells Boba to look in the current directory.
import { say_hello, say_goodbye as farewell } from "./utils.boba"

say_hello() // Prints "Hello!"
farewell() // Prints "Goodbye!"
```

## Importing Everything as a Namespace

To import all public items from a file as a single namespace, you can use the `import * as namespace from "path"` syntax.

```boba
// in utils.boba
pub fn say_hello() {
    print("Hello!")
}
pub fn say_goodbye() {
    print("Goodbye!")
}

// in main.boba
// The `import * as ...` syntax imports all public items under a single namespace.
import * as utils from "./utils.boba"

utils.say_hello()
utils.say_goodbye()
