title: "Chapter 11: Structuring Your Project: Modules"
description: "Learn how to organize your Boba code into multiple files and share code between them using the `import` keyword."
---

As your programs grow larger, it becomes important to organize your code into multiple files. Boba allows you to do this using modules and the `import` keyword.

By default, all items you define in a file—functions, structs, etc.—are private, meaning they can only be used within that same file. To make an item part of a file's public API so it can be imported elsewhere, you must mark it with the `pub` keyword.

## Private by Default

By default, functions are private, meaning they can only be called from within the same file. To make a function accessible from other files, you must use the `pub` keyword.

```boba
// This function can only be called from this file.
fn my_private_function() {
  print("This is a secret!")
}
```

Because this function is private, any attempt to import and call it from `main.boba` would result in a compile error.

You can import public functions, structs, enums, and other declarations from other Boba files. This allows you to break your code into logical modules and reuse code across your project.

> For the following examples, assume you have two files, `utils.boba` and `main.boba`, located together in the same directory.

## Importing Specific Items

To import specific items from a file, you list them by name inside curly braces `{}`, and can optionally rename them with `as`.

```boba
// in utils.boba
pub fn say_hello() {
    print("Hello!")
}
pub fn say_goodbye() {
    print("Goodbye!")
}

// in main.boba
// The `./` is important! It tells Boba to look in the current directory.
import { say_hello, say_goodbye as farewell } from "./utils.boba"

say_hello() // Prints "Hello!"
farewell() // Prints "Goodbye!"
```

## Importing Everything as a Namespace

To import everything from a file as a single namespace, you can use the `* as <name>` syntax.

```boba
// in utils.boba
pub fn say_hello() { /* ... */ }
pub fn say_goodbye() { /* ... */ }

// in main.boba
// The `* as <name>` syntax imports all public items under a single namespace.
import * as utils from "./utils.boba"

utils.say_hello()
utils.say_goodbye()
