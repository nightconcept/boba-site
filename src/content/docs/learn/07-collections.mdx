While primitive types are the basic building blocks for data, most real-world programs need to work with collections of data. Boba provides two primary, built-in collection types for this purpose: `list` and `map`.

### `list`

A `list` is an ordered collection of values of the same type. Lists are dynamic, meaning you can add or remove items.

```boba
// A list of numbers
var highScores: int[] = [100, 95, 80]

// A list of strings
var ingredients: string[] = ["flour", "sugar", "boba pearls"]
```

Lists declared with `let` are immutable, meaning their contents cannot be changed after creation. If you try to modify a list created with `let`, the Boba compiler will report an error.

```boba
let starting_gear: string[] = ["tunic", "dagger"]
// starting_gear.push("shield") // This would cause a compile error because the list is immutable.
```

You can perform many operations on lists, like getting their size or adding new items.

```boba
print(ingredients.len()) // Outputs: 3

// Add a new item to the end
ingredients.push("tapioca pearls")
print(ingredients.len()) // Outputs: 4

// Access items by their index (starting from 0)
print(ingredients[0]) // Outputs: "flour"

Boba lists are "zero-indexed," which means the first item is at index 0, the second at index 1, and so on.
```

### `map`

A `map` is a collection of key-value pairs. Think of a map like a dictionary, where each 'key' is a unique word and the 'value' is its definition. Each key must be unique, and all keys must be of the same type, as must all values.

```boba
// Create a map with string keys and number values
var scores: [string:int] = {
  "ada": 100,
  "grace": 95
}

// Check its initial size
print(scores.len()) // Outputs: 2

// Insert a new key-value pair
scores["boba"] = 105

// Check the new size
print(scores.len()) // Outputs: 3
```

To read a value from a map, you use square brackets `[]` with the key.

```boba
let adas_score = scores["ada"]
print(f"Ada's score is: {adas_score}") // Outputs: Ada's score is: 100
```

But what happens if you try to access a key that doesn't exist? In many languages, this can lead to unexpected crashes (like a `KeyError` in Python) or silent errors (like returning `undefined` in JavaScript). Boba prevents these problems. Accessing a key in a map doesn't return the value directly. Instead, it returns a special `Option` type, which safely handles cases where the key might not exist. We will cover this powerful feature in a later chapter.
