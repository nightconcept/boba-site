As your programs grow larger, it becomes important to organize your code into multiple files. Boba allows you to do this using the `import` keyword.

## Importing from Other Files

You can import public functions, classes, and other declarations from other Boba files. This allows you to break your code into logical modules and reuse code across your project.

### Importing Specific Items

To import specific items from a file, you list them by name.

```boba
// in utils.boba
pub fn sayHello() -> void {
  print("Hello!")
}

// in main.boba
import sayHello from "./utils.boba"

sayHello() // Prints "Hello!"
```

### Importing Everything

To import everything from a file, you can use the `*` wildcard.

```boba
// in utils.boba
pub fn sayHello() -> void { ... }
pub fn sayGoodbye() -> void { ... }

// in main.boba
import * from "./utils.boba"

sayHello()
sayGoodbye()
```

### Renaming Imports

You can rename an imported item using the `as` keyword. This is useful to avoid naming conflicts.

```boba
// in utils.boba
pub fn sayHello() -> void { ... }

// in main.boba
import sayHello as greet from "./utils.boba"

greet() // Prints "Hello!"
```

## A Note on Paths

Import paths are always relative to the current file.

Congratulations! You have completed the Boba language tutorial. You've learned about variables, data types, control flow, functions, and how to structure your code. You now have a solid foundation in the core concepts of the language.

The journey doesn't end here. The next logical step is to explore the guides on how to configure your project and use the Boba tooling effectively. Happy coding!
