Boba provides a powerful `match` statement for checking a variable against a series of possible values. It's a clean and expressive way to handle multiple distinct cases, especially when working with `enum` types.

A `match` statement is often used with `enum` types.

```boba
enum TrafficLight {
  RED,
  YELLOW,
  GREEN
}

var light = TrafficLight.RED

match light {
  TrafficLight.RED => print("Stop!"),
  TrafficLight.YELLOW => print("Caution!"),
  TrafficLight.GREEN => print("Go!"),
  _ => print("Light is broken.") // `_` is a wildcard for any other case
}
```

## Advanced Pattern Matching

Boba's `match` statement can do much more than simple value checking. You can also match on types and use `where` clauses for complex conditions.

```boba
var myVariable = 150

match myVariable {
  1 => print("It was one!"),
  x where x > 100 => print("It's a big number: {x}"),
  s: string => print("It's a string of length {s.len()}"),
  _ => print("Default case")
}
```

With `match`, you can write incredibly clear and robust logic. In the next chapter, we'll learn how to organize our code into reusable blocks called functions.
