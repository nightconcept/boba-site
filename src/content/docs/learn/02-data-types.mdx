In the last chapter, you learned how to create variables and constants. Now, let's explore the fundamental data types you'll use to store different kinds of information in Boba.

## Primitive Types

Boba has a set of primitive types that are the building blocks of data in your programs.

### `number`

The `number` type is used to represent 64-bit floating-point numbers. This is suitable for a wide range of applications, from simple arithmetic to more complex calculations.

```boba
var price: number = 19.99
var quantity: number = 3
var total = price * quantity // total is inferred as a number
```

*Note: While Boba's `number` type is versatile, be mindful of standard floating-point precision limitations when working with very large integers (greater than 2^53).*

### `string`

The `string` type is used to represent text.

```boba
var message: string = "Hello, Boba!"
var playerName = "Ada" // Inferred as a string
```

### `boolean`

The `boolean` type represents a value that can be either `true` or `false`. Booleans are essential for controlling the flow of your program.

```boba
var isGameOver: boolean = false
var hasKey = true // Inferred as a boolean
```

## Composite Types

Boba also has composite types, which are made up of primitive types.

### `list`

A `list` is an ordered collection of values of the same type. Lists are dynamic, meaning you can add or remove items.

```boba
// A list of numbers
var highScores: number[] = [100, 95, 80]

// A list of strings
var ingredients: string[] = ["flour", "sugar", "boba pearls"]
```

### `map`

A `map` is a collection of key-value pairs. Each key must be unique, and all keys must be of the same type, as must all values.

```boba
// A map with string keys and number values
var scores: [string:number] = {
  "ada": 100,
  "grace": 95
}
```

In the next chapter, we'll look at how to use these types with operators to perform calculations and make comparisons.
