Boba provides familiar operators with some improvements for readability and safety. Most operators work exactly as you'd expect from other languages, with a few key differences that make code more readable.

## Arithmetic Operators

Standard mathematical operations with predictable integer division:

```boba
let a = 10
let b = 3

let sum = a + b      // 13
let diff = a - b     // 7
let product = a * b  // 30
let quotient = a / b // 3 (integer division)
let remainder = a % b // 1

// Float division
let precise = 10.0 / 3.0  // 3.333...
```

## Comparison Operators

All comparison operations return boolean values for use in conditionals:

```boba
let score = 85

// Basic comparisons
let passing = score >= 60        // true
let perfect = score == 100       // false
let needs_work = score < 70      // false

// Results are boolean values
if passing {
    print("Student passed!")
}
```

## Logical Operators

Boba uses English words for logical operations, making code more readable than symbolic operators:

```boba
let has_key = true
let door_locked = false

// Logical operations  
let can_enter = has_key and not door_locked  // true
let stuck_outside = not has_key or door_locked  // false

// Short-circuit evaluation
if has_key and door_locked {
    print("Have key but door is locked")
}
```

## Control Flow: if/else

Boba's `if/else` statements work as both statements and expressions, letting you assign their results to variables:

```boba
let temperature = 30.0

if temperature > 25 {
    print("It's hot!")
} else if temperature > 15 {
    print("Nice weather")
} else {
    print("It's cold")
}

// if/else as expressions
let status = if score >= 60 { "pass" } else { "fail" }
```

## Bitwise Operators

For low-level operations and flag manipulation:

```boba
let flags = 0b1010_0101
let mask = 0b1111_0000

// Bitwise operations
let and_result = flags & mask     // 0b1010_0000
let or_result = flags | mask      // 0b1111_0101
let xor_result = flags ^ mask     // 0b0101_0101
let not_result = ~flags           // Inverts all bits

// Shifts for fast multiplication/division by powers of 2
let doubled = flags << 1          // Multiply by 2
let halved = flags >> 1           // Divide by 2
```

### Example: Permission Flags

```boba
// Define permissions as bit flags
let CAN_READ = 1     // 0b001
let CAN_WRITE = 2    // 0b010  
let CAN_EXECUTE = 4  // 0b100

// Combine permissions
let user_perms = CAN_READ | CAN_WRITE  // 0b011

// Check permissions
if user_perms & CAN_WRITE != 0 {
    print("User can write")
}

if user_perms & CAN_EXECUTE == 0 {
    print("User cannot execute")
}
```

## Multi-line Conditions

For complex conditions, wrap in parentheses:

```boba
let has_permission = true
let is_authenticated = true
let rate_limit_ok = true

// Clean formatting for complex conditions
if (has_permission and 
    is_authenticated and 
    rate_limit_ok) {
    print("Access granted")
}
```

## Collection Containment

The `in` operator provides a clean way to check membership in collections:

```boba
// Note: Collections covered in detail next chapter
let valid_statuses = ["pending", "approved", "rejected"]
let current_status = "approved"

if current_status in valid_statuses {
    print("Valid status")
} else {
    print("Invalid status") 
}
```

## Operator Design Principles

Boba uses English words for logical operations (`and`, `or`, `not`) to make code more readable than symbolic operators. Integer division is the default behavior, with explicit float types needed for decimal results.

The `in` operator provides clean membership testing for collections, and `if/else` expressions let you assign conditional values directly to variables.

## Time to Practice!

Experiment with Boba's operators and control flow:

1. **Try arithmetic operations**: Practice with integer vs. float division
2. **Write conditionals**: Use comparison operators in `if/else` statements
3. **Use logical operators**: Combine conditions with `and`, `or`, and `not`
4. **Experiment with expressions**: Use `if/else` as expressions to assign values
5. **Play with bitwise operations**: Try the permission flags example

## What's Next

You now understand Boba's operator system and control flow mechanisms. The English-word logical operators make code more readable, and treating `if/else` as expressions enables more functional programming patterns. Next, you'll learn about collections - lists, maps, and tuples - which let you work with multiple related values efficiently.
