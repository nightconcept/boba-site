title: "Philosophy: Encouraging Pure Functions"
description: "Learn about Boba's design philosophy that encourages pure functions for more predictable and testable code."

While Boba is a multi-paradigm language and not strictly functional, its design and standard library conventions strongly encourage a pure functional style wherever possible.

A **pure function** is a function that has two key properties:

1.  **Deterministic:** Given the same input, it will always return the same output.
2.  **No Side Effects:** It does not modify any state outside of its own scope (like changing a global variable or writing to a file).

Writing code with pure functions makes it easier to test, reason about, and verify, both for humans and for automated tools.

## The Guideline: Transform Data, Don't Mutate

This philosophy is a design guideline, not a strict compiler rule. The core idea is that functions that transform data should return **new** data rather than modifying their inputs in-place.

A function that *does* mutate its input should have a name that makes this behavior explicit (e.g., `sort_in_place`).

### Example: Purity in the Standard Library

Let's see how this principle applies to a common task: sorting a list.

```boba
let original_list = [3, 1, 2]

// PURE: The sorted() function returns a NEW, sorted list.
let sorted_list = original_list.sorted()

// The original list is untouched.
print(original_list) // Output: [3, 1, 2]

// The new list contains the sorted data.
print(sorted_list) // Output: [1, 2, 3]
```

For cases where performance is critical and you want to avoid allocating a new list, a separate, clearly-named "impure" version is provided.

```boba
// IMPURE (but clearly named): The sort_in_place() method modifies the list.
var mutable_list = [3, 1, 2]
mutable_list.sort_in_place()

// The original list has been mutated.
print(mutable_list) // Output: [1, 2, 3]
```

By embracing this philosophy, you can build more robust and maintainable systems in Boba. This style makes your program's data flow explicit and predictable.
