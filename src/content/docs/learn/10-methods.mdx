In the last chapter, we learned how to group data using `structs`. Now, let's give them behavior by implementing functions on them, called **methods**. We do this using an `impl` (implementation) block.

## The `impl` Block

The `impl` block is where you define all the functions that belong to a `struct`.

```boba
struct Player {
  name: string,
  health: int
}

impl Player {
  // All functions related to Player will go in here.
}
```

## Associated Functions and Constructors

An **associated function** is a function that belongs to a type but is not called on a specific instance (like a `static` method in other languages). The most common associated function is `new()`, which is the idiomatic Boba convention for a constructor.

```boba
impl Player {
    // Creates a new Player with default health.
    pub fn new(name: string) -> Player {
        return Player {
            name: name,
            health: 100
        }
    }
}
```

**Field Init Shorthand**

In the `new` function, we wrote `name: name`. When a local variable has the same name as a struct field, Boba allows you to use a shorthand. You could write this more idiomatically as:

```boba
fn new(name: string) -> Player {
  return Player {
    name, // No need to write `name: name`
    health: 100
  }
}
```

You call an associated function directly on the type. Here's how you would create a new `Player` using the `new` function:

```boba
let player = Player.new(name: "Ada")
```

## Methods and the `self` Parameter

A **method** is a function within an `impl` block that takes `self` as its first parameter. `self` represents the specific instance of the struct the method is being called on. By default, the `self` parameter provides immutable, read-only access to the struct's instance.

> For developers coming from languages like JavaScript, Python, or Java, `self` is the equivalent of `this`.

```boba
impl Player {
    // ... new() function from before ...

    /// A method that prints the player's status.
    /// The `self` parameter gives us read-only access to the instance.
    pub fn print_status(self) {
        print(f"{self.name}'s health is {self.health}.")
    }
}
```

## Mutating State with `mut self`

By default, `self` is immutable. If a method needs to _change_ the struct's data, you must mark the parameter as `mut self`. This is an explicit signal that the method has side effects on the instance.

```boba
impl Player {
    // ... new() and print_status() from before ...

    /// Reduces the player's health by a given amount.
    pub fn take_damage(mut self, amount: int) {
        self.health -= amount
        print(f"{self.name} takes {amount} damage!")
    }
}
```

To be able to call a method that mutates its instance, the instance itself must be declared as mutable using `var`. The compiler will prevent you from calling a `mut self` method on an immutable `let` binding. Here is a full example:

```boba
// First, create a mutable Player instance named boba_dev using var.
var boba_dev = Player.new(name: "Boba Dev")

// Next, print the player's initial health.
print(f"Initial health: {boba_dev.health}") // Outputs: Initial health: 100

// Then, call the take_damage method on boba_dev.
boba_dev.take_damage(amount: 25)

// Finally, print the player's health again to show it has been reduced.
print(f"Updated health: {boba_dev.health}") // Outputs: Updated health: 75
```
