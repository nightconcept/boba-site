Structs, short for structures, are custom data types you can create by grouping together related variables. Think of a struct definition as a blueprint: it defines the shape and fields for a concept in your program. From that blueprint, you can then create multiple concrete instances.

## Defining a Struct

You define a struct using the `struct` keyword. Inside the struct definition, you list the variables (called fields) that make up the struct.

```boba
// Define a `Player` struct
struct Player {
  name: string,
  score: int,
  is_active: boolean
}
```

<<<<<<< Updated upstream

Structs can also have default values for their fields.

```boba
struct Player {
  name: string = "Boba Dev",
  score: int = 0,
  is_active: boolean = false
}
```

## Creating an Instance of a Struct

Once you have defined a struct, you can create instances of it using a struct literal.

```boba
// Create a new variable `ada` of type `Player`
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
let ada: Player = { name: "Ada", score: 100, is_active: true }
=======
let ada: Player = Player{ name: "Ada", score: 100, is_active: true }
>>>>>>> Stashed changes
```

## Accessing Struct Fields

You can access the fields of a struct instance using dot notation.

```boba
print(f"Player name: {ada.name}") // Prints "Player name: Ada"
```

### Composing Structs

The real power of structs becomes apparent when you use them to build more complex data structures. A struct's fields can be of any type, including other structs you have defined. This is called composition.

```boba
struct Point {
  x: int,
  y: int,
}

struct Line {
  start: Point, // This field is another struct
  end: Point,   // This one too
}

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
let my_line = Line {
=======
let my_line = Line{
>>>>>>> Stashed changes
  start: Point { x: 10, y: 20 },
  end: Point { x: 50, y: 30 },
}

// You can chain dot notation to access nested fields
print(f"The line starts at x = {my_line.start.x}")
```

### Field Visibility and the `pub` Keyword

By default, all fields in a struct are **private**. This means they can only be accessed by code in the same file where the struct is defined. This is a core principle of encapsulation, preventing external code from relying on the internal structure of your data.

To make a field part of the struct's public API, you must explicitly mark it with the `pub` keyword.

Think of it like a building: some rooms (private fields) are for internal staff only, while the reception area (`pub` fields) is accessible to the public.

This principle of encapsulation allows the author of a struct to later refactor or change the internal, private fields without breaking the code of users who depend on it, as long as the public API (the `pub` fields) remains consistent.

```boba
// in a file named `user.boba`

pub struct User {
  pub id: int,      // This field is public and can be accessed from other files.
  username: string, // This field is private to `user.boba`.
  email: string,    // This is also private.
}
```

If you tried to access `some_user.username` from a different file, the compiler would stop you, enforcing the privacy rules you've defined.

### Mutating a Struct
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
To create a mutable instance whose fields you can modify, you must declare the variable using `var`. If a struct instance is bound using `let`, it is deeply immutable—neither the variable can be reassigned, nor can its fields be changed.
```boba
// Create a mutable Player instance
var boba_dev: Player = { name: "Boba Dev", score: 0, is_active: false }
=======
To create a mutable instance whose fields you can modify, you must declare the variable using `var`. If a struct instance is bound using `let`, it is deeply immutable—neither the variable can be reassigned, nor can its fields be changed. The fields of a struct that you want to be mutable must be marked with the `pub` keyword.

```boba
pub struct Player {
  pub name: string,
  pub score: int,
  pub is_active: boolean

}

// Create a mutable Player instance
var boba_dev: Player = Player{ name: "Boba Dev", score: 0, is_active: false }
>>>>>>> Stashed changes
print(f"Initial score: {boba_dev.score}") // Outputs: Initial score: 0

// Mutate the score field
boba_dev.score = 150
print(f"Updated score: {boba_dev.score}") // Outputs: Updated score: 150
```

### Creating a New Struct from an Old One

Often, instead of mutating a struct, you'll want to create a new instance based on an old one but with some fields changed. Boba provides a convenient struct update syntax for this. The .. operator specifies that the remaining unmentioned fields should be copied directly from another instance.

```boba
let player1 = Player { name: "Ada", score: 100, is_active: true }

// Create player2 based on player1, but with a different score.
// The `name` and `is_active` fields are copied from player1.
let player2 = Player { score: 150, ..player1 }

print(f"{player2.name} has a new score of {player2.score}")
=======
#### Unpacking Values: Destructuring with let

After creating an instance of a struct, you'll often want to extract its field values into local variables. While you can access them one by one using dot notation, Boba provides a more powerful and ergonomic feature called destructuring.

Destructuring lets you bind a struct's fields to new variables in a single, declarative statement.

```boba
// Given our Player struct from before
let ada: Player = Player{ name: "Ada", score: 100, is_active: true }

// ada could also be declared like this:
// let ada = Player{ name: "Ada", score: 100, is_active: true }

// The old way requires one line per variable.
let ada_name = ada.name
let ada_score = ada.score

// The idiomatic Boba way uses destructuring.
let { name, score } = ada
print(f"Player: {name}, Score: {score}") // Prints "Player: Ada, Score: 100"
```

This pattern should feel familiar—it's the same concept you use when looping over maps with for key, value in my_map.items(). By allowing it in let bindings, Boba makes the language more consistent and expressive.

#### Picking and Choosing Fields

You don't have to destructure every field. If you only need a few values, you can use .. to signal that you are intentionally ignoring the rest of the fields.

```boba
// We only need the name for a greeting.
let { name, .. } = ada
print(f"Welcome, {name}!")
```

This is safer and clearer than leaving fields out, as it explicitly states your intent to ignore the others.

### Creating a New Struct from an Old One with Spread

A common pattern in writing safe, predictable code is to favor creating new, updated instances rather than mutating existing ones. Boba makes this pattern ergonomic and consistent with a feature you've already seen: the spread operator (`...`).

Just as you can use `...` to spread the elements of one list or map into another, you can use it to copy the fields from an existing struct instance into a new one. This allows you to concisely create a new struct that is a copy of an old one, with only a few fields changed.

```boba
let player1: Player = Player{ name: "Ada", score: 100, is_active: true }

// Create player2 based on player1, but with a different score.
// The ...player1 syntax copies the `name` and `is_active` fields.
let player2 = Player{ score: 150, ...player1 }

print(f"{player2.name} has a new score of {player2.score}")
// Outputs: Ada has a new score of 150

### Time to Practice!

You now know how to bundle related data together. This is the first half of creating powerful custom types. In the next chapter, we will bring this data to life by giving our structs behavior with methods.
