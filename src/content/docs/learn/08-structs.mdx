Structs, short for structures, are custom data types you can create by grouping together related variables. Think of a struct definition as a blueprint: it defines the shape and fields for a concept in your program. From that blueprint, you can then create multiple concrete instances.

## Defining a Struct

You define a struct using the `struct` keyword. Inside the struct definition, you list the variables (called fields) that make up the struct.

```boba
// Define a `Player` struct
struct Player {
  name: string,
  score: int,
  is_active: boolean
}
```

## Creating an Instance of a Struct

Once you have defined a struct, you can create instances of it using a struct literal.

```boba
// Create a new variable `ada` of type `Player`
let ada: Player = { name: "Ada", score: 100, is_active: true }
```

## Accessing Struct Fields

You can access the fields of a struct instance using dot notation.

```boba
print(f"Player name: {ada.name}") // Prints "Player name: Ada"
```

### Mutating a Struct
In a new paragraph, explain that you use the `var` keyword to create mutable struct instances.
```boba
// Create a mutable Player instance
var boba_dev: Player = { name: "Boba Dev", score: 0, is_active: false }
print(f"Initial score: {boba_dev.score}") // Outputs: Initial score: 0

// Mutate the score field
boba_dev.score = 150
print(f"Updated score: {boba_dev.score}") // Outputs: Updated score: 150
```

### Time to Practice!

You now know how to bundle related data together. This is the first half of creating powerful custom types. In the next chapter, we will bring this data to life by giving our structs behavior with methods.
