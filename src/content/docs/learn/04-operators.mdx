Now that you know about variables and data types, let's look at how to manipulate them using operators. Operators are special symbols that perform operations on your data.

## Arithmetic Operators

Boba provides a standard set of arithmetic operators for performing mathematical calculations.

| Operator | Description      | Example                |
| :------- | :--------------- | :--------------------- |
| `+`      | Addition         | `5 + 2` results in `7`   |
| `-`      | Subtraction      | `5 - 2` results in `3`   |
| `*`      | Multiplication   | `5 * 2` results in `10`  |
| `/`      | Division         | `5 / 2` results in `2.5` |
| `%`      | Modulo (remainder) | `5 % 2` results in `1`   |
| `^`      | Power (Note: some languages like Python and JavaScript use `**` for this) | `5 ^ 2` results in `25`  |

### Unary Arithmetic Operators

You can also increment or decrement a number by one using the `++` and `--` operators.

```boba
var score: int = 10
score++ // score is now 11
score-- // score is now 10
```

### Numeric Operations and Conversions

When you mix integer (`int`) and floating-point (`float`) numbers, Boba follows simple rules to keep things predictable.

1.  **Mixed-Type Math**: If you perform math (`+`, `-`, `*`) between an `int` and a `float`, the result is always a `float`.
    -   `10 (int) + 2.5 (float)` results in `12.5 (float)`.

2.  **Division Always Returns a Float**: The division operator `/` always produces a `float` to avoid bugs where whole number division gives unexpected results.
    -   `5 (int) / 2 (int)` results in `2.5 (float)`.

3.  **Explicit Conversion**: To turn a `float` into an `int`, you must be explicit with the `as` keyword, which truncates the decimal.
    -   `let my_float: float = 9.9; let my_int = my_float as int; // my_int is 9`

## Comparison Operators

Comparison operators are used to compare two values. They always result in a `boolean` (`true` or `false`) value.

| Operator | Description          | Example               |
| :------- | :------------------- | :-------------------- |
| `==`     | Equal to             | `5 == 5` is `true`    |
| `!=`     | Not equal to         | `5 != 5` is `false`   |
| `<`      | Less than            | `5 < 8` is `true`     |
| `>`      | Greater than         | `5 > 8` is `false`    |
| `<=`     | Less than or equal   | `5 <= 5` is `true`    |
| `>=`     | Greater than or equal| `5 >= 8` is `false`   |

In Boba, comparisons must be explicit. You can't use a non-boolean value in a context that expects a boolean.

```boba
// WRONG
var score: int = 100
// if (score) { ... } // This will cause a compile error.

// RIGHT
if (score != 0) { ... } // The result of `!=` is a boolean.
```

## Logical Operators

Logical operators are used to combine boolean values.

| Operator | Description | Example                               |
| :------- | :---------- | :------------------------------------ |
| `and`    | Logical AND | `true and false` results in `false` |
| `or`     | Logical OR  | `true or false` results in `true`   |
| `not`    | Logical NOT | `not true` results in `false`       |

```boba
var hasKey = true
var isDoorLocked = false

if (hasKey and not isDoorLocked) {
  print("You can open the door!")
}
```

### Bitwise Operators: Working with Individual Bits

While arithmetic operators work on a number's mathematical value, **bitwise operators** allow you to manipulate the individual `1`s and `0`s (bits) that make up an `int`. This is a powerful technique for efficiently storing sets of on/off flags, working with certain data formats, and performance-critical code.

#### The Scenario: Player Permissions

Let's imagine we're building a game where a player has guild permissions. We can store all their permissions in a single `int`. First, we define each permission as a constant, using powers of two to ensure each one occupies a unique bit.

```boba
// Each permission corresponds to a single bit.
const CAN_INVITE:  int = 1  // Binary: ...0001
const CAN_KICK:    int = 2  // Binary: ...0010
const CAN_PROMOTE: int = 4  // Binary: ...0100
```

#### Combining Flags with OR (`|`)

To grant a player multiple permissions, we use the bitwise OR operator. It combines the bits from both numbers.
```boba
// Let's grant a player permission to invite AND kick members.
let player_perms: int = CAN_INVITE | CAN_KICK
// In binary: 0001 | 0010  =  0011 (Decimal 3)
```

#### Checking for a Flag with AND (`&`)

To check if a player has a _specific_ permission, we use the bitwise AND operator. This is the most common bitwise operation.

```boba
// Does our player (perms value is 3) have permission to kick?
// The result will be non-zero only if the CAN_KICK bit is set.
if (player_perms & CAN_KICK != 0) {
  print("Yes, this player can kick.") // This will print.
}

// Do they have permission to promote?
if (player_perms & CAN_PROMOTE == 0) {
  print("No, this player cannot promote.") // This will print.
}
```

#### Other Bitwise Operators

Boba also supports other standard bitwise operators for advanced use cases:

- **`^` (XOR):** Toggles a bit (useful for flipping a state).
- **`~` (NOT):** Flips all bits in a number.
- **`<<` (Left Shift) and `>>` (Right Shift):** Move all bits to the left or right (useful for low-level data packing and fast multiplication/division by two).
```boba
let x: int = 4 // Binary: 0100

// Left shift by 1 (multiplies by 2)
print(x << 1) // Outputs 8 (Binary: 1000)

// Right shift by 2 (divides by 4)
print(x >> 2) // Outputs 1 (Binary: 0001)
```
With these operators, you can start writing more complex and interesting programs. In the next chapter, we'll explore how to control the flow of your program using conditionals.
