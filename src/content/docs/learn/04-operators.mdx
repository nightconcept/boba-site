Now that you know about variables and data types, let's look at how to manipulate them using operators. Operators are special symbols that perform operations on your data.

## Arithmetic Operators

Boba provides a standard set of arithmetic operators for performing mathematical calculations.

| Operator | Description      | Example                |
| :------- | :--------------- | :--------------------- |
| `+`      | Addition         | `5 + 2` results in `7`   |
| `-`      | Subtraction      | `5 - 2` results in `3`   |
| `*`      | Multiplication   | `5 * 2` results in `10`  |
| `/`      | Division         | `5 / 2` results in `2.5` |
| `%`      | Modulo (remainder) | `5 % 2` results in `1`   |
| `^`      | Power (Note: some languages like Python and JavaScript use `**` for this) | `5 ^ 2` results in `25`  |

### Unary Arithmetic Operators

You can also increment or decrement a number by one using the `++` and `--` operators.

```boba
var score = 10
score++ // score is now 11
score-- // score is now 10
```

## Comparison Operators

Comparison operators are used to compare two values. They always result in a `boolean` (`true` or `false`) value.

| Operator | Description          | Example               |
| :------- | :------------------- | :-------------------- |
| `==`     | Equal to             | `5 == 5` is `true`    |
| `!=`     | Not equal to         | `5 != 5` is `false`   |
| `<`      | Less than            | `5 < 8` is `true`     |
| `>`      | Greater than         | `5 > 8` is `false`    |
| `<=`     | Less than or equal   | `5 <= 5` is `true`    |
| `>=`     | Greater than or equal| `5 >= 8` is `false`   |

In Boba, comparisons must be explicit. You can't use a non-boolean value in a context that expects a boolean.

```boba
// WRONG
var score: number = 100
// if (score) { ... } // This will cause a compile error.

// RIGHT
if (score != 0) { ... } // The result of `!=` is a boolean.
```

## Logical Operators

Logical operators are used to combine boolean values.

| Operator | Description | Example                               |
| :------- | :---------- | :------------------------------------ |
| `and`    | Logical AND | `true and false` results in `false` |
| `or`     | Logical OR  | `true or false` results in `true`   |
| `not`    | Logical NOT | `not true` results in `false`       |

```boba
var hasKey = true
var isDoorLocked = false

if (hasKey and not isDoorLocked) {
  print("You can open the door!")
}
```

With these operators, you can start writing more complex and interesting programs. In the next chapter, we'll explore how to control the flow of your program using conditionals.
