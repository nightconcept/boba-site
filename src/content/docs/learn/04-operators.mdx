Now that you know about variables and data types, let's look at how to manipulate them using operators. Operators are special symbols that perform operations on your data.

## Arithmetic Operators

Boba provides a standard set of arithmetic operators for performing mathematical calculations.

| Operator | Description      | Example                |
| :------- | :--------------- | :--------------------- |
| `+`      | Addition         | `5 + 2` results in `7`   |
| `-`      | Subtraction      | `5 - 2` results in `3`   |
| `*`      | Multiplication   | `5 * 2` results in `10`  |
| `/`      | Division         | `5 / 2` results in `2.5` |
| `%`      | Modulo (remainder) | `5 % 2` results in `1`   |
| `^`      | Power (Note: some languages like Python and JavaScript use `**` for this) | `5 ^ 2` results in `25`  |

```boba
let score = 10
let bonus = score * 2
let total_score = score + bonus
let final_level = total_score / 10

print(f"Final level is: {final_level}") // Outputs: Final level is: 3
// Note: 30 / 10 results in an integer. We will discuss float division later.
```

## Comparison Operators

Comparison operators are used to compare two values. They always result in a `boolean` (`true` or `false`) value.

| Operator | Description          | Example               |
| :------- | :------------------- | :-------------------- |
| `==`     | Equal to             | `5 == 5` is `true`    |
| `!=`     | Not equal to         | `5 != 5` is `false`   |
| `<`      | Less than            | `5 < 8` is `true`     |
| `>`      | Greater than         | `5 > 8` is `false`    |
| `<=`     | Less than or equal   | `5 <= 5` is `true`    |
| `>=`     | Greater than or equal| `5 >= 8` is `false`   |

```boba
let score = 85
let is_passing = score >= 60

print(f"Is the student passing? {is_passing}") // Outputs: Is the student passing? true
```

### Checking for Containment with 'in'

To check if an element exists within a `list`, `map`, or `string`, you can use the highly readable `in` operator.

```boba
let inventory: string[] = ["sword", "shield", "potion"]

// Check if "shield" is in our inventory list.
if "shield" in inventory {
  print("You are well-defended!")
}

let player_skills = {"archery": 5, "magic": 3}

// For maps, `in` checks if the key exists.
if "stealth" in player_skills {
  print("You can sneak.")
} else {
  print("You are not a sneaky person.") // This will print.
}
```

## Logical Operators

Logical operators are used to combine boolean values.

| Operator | Description | Example                               |
| :------- | :---------- | :------------------------------------ |
| `and`    | Logical AND | `true and false` results in `false` |
| `or`     | Logical OR  | `true or false` results in `true`   |
| `not`    | Logical NOT | `not true` results in `false`       |

```boba
let has_key = true
let is_door_locked = false

if has_key and not is_door_locked {
  print("You can enter the room.") // This will print.
}
```
