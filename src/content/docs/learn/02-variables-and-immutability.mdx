In Boba, you can store data in variables. A core principle of the language is **immutability by default**, which helps you write safer, more predictable code.

### `let`: Immutable Bindings

The `let` keyword declares an **immutable binding**. Once a value is assigned, it cannot be changed. This should be your default choice for everything, as it prevents accidental modification. This design choice helps prevent a large class of common bugs where data is changed unintentionally. It makes code easier to reason about because you know a value won't change unexpectedly.

```boba
let message = "Hello, Boba!"
message = "Hello, Dave!" // This will cause a compile error!
```

### Your First Compiler Error: A Helpful Guide

When you try to run the code above, the Boba compiler will stop and show you an error. It might look something like this:

```
Error: Cannot assign twice to immutable binding `message`.
  --> hello.boba:2:1
  |
1 | let message = "Hello, Boba!"
  |     ------- help: `message` is declared immutable here.
2 | message = "Hello, Dave!"
  | ^^^^^^^ cannot assign to `message`
  |
  = help: To make this binding mutable, use `var` instead of `let`.
```

This is a key part of the Boba development experience. The compiler is your pair programmer. It doesn't just point out errors; it often tells you exactly how to fix them. Learning to read these messages is a superpower.

### `var`: Mutable Variables

You should only use the `var` keyword when you have a specific and necessary reason to change a value after it's been created. You should use `var` only when you explicitly need to track a state that changes over time, such as a counter in a loop, a user's accumulating score, or a value that is built up incrementally.

```boba
// A mutable variable, used only when mutation is required.
var counter = 0
counter = counter + 1 // This is allowed.
```

By defaulting to `let` for everything, you make your code's intent clearer and safer.

### Core Data Types

Now that you know how to declare variables with `let` and `var`, let's explore the fundamental types of data they can hold. Boba has a set of primitive types that are the building blocks of data in your programs. When you want to be explicit, you can add a type annotation after the variable name using a colon, like this: `let name: type = value`.

### `int`

The `int` type is used to represent a 64-bit signed integer (a whole number). It is the ideal type for counting, indexing into collections, representing IDs, and any situation where fractional values are not needed.
```boba
let score: int = 100
let current_level = 10 // Inferred as int
```

#### Numeric Bases

Boba supports writing numbers in different bases using standard prefixes:

```boba
// Hexadecimal (base-16) with prefix 0x
let red_color = 0xFF0000        // 16711680 in decimal
let alpha = 0xFF                // 255 in decimal

// Octal (base-8) with prefix 0o
let file_perms = 0o755          // 493 in decimal (read/write/execute)
let umask = 0o022              // 18 in decimal

// Binary (base-2) with prefix 0b
let flags = 0b1010_0101        // 165 in decimal
let enabled = 0b1              // 1 in decimal

// You can use numeric separators with any base
let binary_mask = 0b1111_0000  // Using _ for readability
let hex_color = 0xFF_FF_FF     // Same as 0xFFFFFF
```

These different bases are particularly useful when working with:
- Hexadecimal: Colors, byte values, memory addresses
- Octal: File permissions in Unix-like systems
- Binary: Bit flags, low-level operations

#### Numeric Separators

For better readability of large numbers, Boba allows you to use underscores (`_`) as numeric separators. You can place these separators anywhere between digits. This is particularly useful for representing large numbers in a more readable format:

```boba
let million = 1_000_000       // Same as 1000000
let billion = 1_000_000_000   // Clearer than 1000000000
let binary = 0b1010_0101      // Grouping binary digits
let salary = 75_000           // More readable than 75000

// Multiple underscores are also valid
let also_valid = 9__000       // Same as 9000
```

The underscores are ignored by the compiler and are purely for human readability. You can use them in both integer and floating-point numbers.

### `float`

The `float` type is used for 64-bit floating-point numbers (numbers with a decimal point). It's essential for any calculations involving fractional values, such as financial data, measurements, or scientific computations.

```boba
let price: float = 4.99
let temperature = -15.5 // Inferred as float
```

#### Scientific Notation

For very large or very small numbers, Boba supports scientific notation using the `e` or `E` notation. The number after `e` represents the power of 10 to multiply by.

```boba
let plancks_constant: float = 6.626e-34  // 6.626 × 10⁻³⁴
let avogadros_number = 6.022E23         // 6.022 × 10²³
let electron_mass = 9.109e-31           // 9.109 × 10⁻³¹
```

### `string`

The `string` type is used to represent text.

```boba
let message: string = "Hello, Boba!"
var player_name = "June" // Inferred as a string
```

#### Formatting Strings

To embed variables and expressions directly into a string, Boba uses **f-strings**. An f-string is a string literal prefixed with the letter `f`. This prefix acts as a signal that commands the compiler to actively scan the string for `{}` placeholders and evaluate the expressions inside them.

```boba
let player_name = "Ada"
let level: int = 10

// Use an f-string to create a formatted message.
let welcome_message = f"Welcome, {player_name} (Level {level})!"
print(welcome_message) // Outputs: Welcome, Ada (Level 10)!

// Regular strings do not process the braces.
let template = "This is a template: {some_value}"
print(template) // Outputs: This is a template: {some_value}
```

### `boolean`

The `boolean` type represents a value that can be either `true` or `false`. Booleans are essential for controlling the flow of your program.

```boba
var is_game_over: boolean = false
var has_key = true // Inferred as a boolean
```

### Type Inference: Letting Boba Do the Work

In the examples, you may have noticed that sometimes we declare a type (`let score: int = 100`) and sometimes we don't (`let current_level = 10`). When you assign a value as you declare a variable, Boba can usually figure out, or infer, the type for you. `10` is clearly an `int`, `"Ada"` is a `string`, and `true` is a `boolean`. While this makes code more concise, adding explicit type annotations can serve as powerful documentation, especially on function signatures or for complex data. It's a choice the developer makes to balance conciseness with clarity for other developers (or their future self).

#### **Time to Practice!**
