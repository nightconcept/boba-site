In Boba, you can store data in variables. A core principle of the language is **immutability by default**, which helps you write safer, more predictable code.

### `let`: Immutable Bindings

The `let` keyword declares an **immutable binding**. Once a value is assigned, it cannot be changed. This should be your default choice for everything, as it prevents accidental modification.

```boba
let message = "Hello, Boba!"
message = "Hello, Dave!" // This will cause a compile error!
```

### Your First Compiler Error: A Helpful Guide

When you try to run the code above, the Boba compiler will stop and show you an error. It might look something like this:

```boba
Error: Cannot assign twice to immutable binding `message`.
  --> hello.boba:2:1
  |
1 | let message = "Hello, Boba!"
  |     ------- help: `message` is declared immutable here.
2 | message = "Hello, Dave!"
  | ^^^^^^^ cannot assign to `message`
  |
  = help: To make this binding mutable, use `var` instead of `let`.
```

This is a key part of the Boba development experience. The compiler is your assistant. It doesn't just point out errors; it often tells you exactly how to fix them. Learning to read these messages is a superpower.

> **A Note for JavaScript/TypeScript Developers**
>
> In Boba, `let` creates a binding that cannot be reassigned, similar to `const` in JavaScript. This is different from JavaScript's `let`, which creates a mutable variable. For mutable variables in Boba, you must use `var`.

### `var`: Mutable Variables

You should only use the `var` keyword when you have a specific and necessary reason to change a value after it's been created.

```boba
// A mutable variable, used only when mutation is required.
var counter = 0
counter = counter + 1 // This is allowed.
```

By defaulting to `let` for everything, you make your code's intent clearer and safer.

### Core Data Types

Boba has a set of primitive types that are the building blocks of data in your programs.

### `int`

The `int` type is used to represent a 64-bit signed integer (a whole number). It is the ideal type for counting, indexing into collections, representing IDs, and any situation where fractional values are not needed.
```boba
let score: int = 100
let current_level = 10 // Inferred as int
```

### `string`

The `string` type is used to represent text.

```boba
let message: string = "Hello, Boba!"
var player_name = "June" // Inferred as a string
```

##### Formatting Strings with F-Strings

> To embed variables and expressions directly into a string, Boba uses **f-strings**. An f-string is a string literal prefixed with the letter `f`. This explicitly tells the compiler to process any expressions inside curly braces `{}`.

```boba
let player_name = "Ada"
let level: int = 10

// Use an f-string to create a formatted message.
let welcome_message = f"Welcome, {player_name} (Level {level})!" 
print(welcome_message) // Outputs: Welcome, Ada (Level 10)!

// Regular strings do not process the braces.
let template = "This is a template: {some_value}"
print(template) // Outputs: This is a template: {some_value}
```

### `boolean`

The `boolean` type represents a value that can be either `true` or `false`. Booleans are essential for controlling the flow of your program.

```boba
var is_game_over: boolean = false
var has_key = true // Inferred as a boolean
```

### Type Inference: Letting Boba Do the Work

In the examples, you may have noticed that sometimes we declare a type (`let score: int = 100`) and sometimes we don't (`let current_level = 10`). When you assign a value as you declare a variable, Boba can usually figure out, or infer, the type for you. `10` is clearly an `int`, `"Ada"` is a `string`, and `true` is a `boolean`. This is a convenience feature to keep your code concise. You should add an explicit type annotation when it helps improve clarity.
