Structs, short for structures, allow you to create your own custom data types by grouping together related variables. This is a powerful way to organize and manage complex data in your programs.

## Defining a Struct

You define a struct using the `struct` keyword. Inside the struct definition, you list the variables (called fields) that make up the struct.

```boba
// Define a `Player` struct
struct Player = {
  name: string,
  score: number,
  is_active: boolean
}
```

## Creating an Instance of a Struct

Once you have defined a struct, you can create instances of it, just like you would with any other data type.

```boba
// Create a new variable `ada` of type `Player`
var ada: Player = { name = "Ada", score = 100, is_active = true }
```

## Accessing Struct Fields

You can access the fields of a struct instance using dot notation.

```boba
print("Player name: {ada.name}") // Prints "Player name: Ada"

// You can also modify the fields of a struct instance
ada.score = 110
```

Structs are a great way to model the data in your application. In the next chapter, we'll look at another way to create custom types: enums.
