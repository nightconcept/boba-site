In any real-world application, things can go wrong. A file might not exist, a network request might fail, or user input might be invalid. While other languages often rely on exceptions and `try...catch` blocks to handle these situations, Boba encourages a more explicit approach using the `Result` enum. The benefit of this approach is that using `Result` makes a function's potential for failure an honest part of its type signature, forcing the caller to acknowledge and handle potential errors at compile time.

## The `Result` Enum

The `Result` enum is a powerful tool for handling operations that can either succeed or fail.

```boba
enum Result<T, E> {
  Ok(T),    // The 'Success' variant, holds a value of type T
  Err(E)    // The 'Failure' variant, holds a value of type E
}
```

- `T` is a generic placeholder for the type of data you expect on success.
- `E` is a generic placeholder for the type of error you expect on failure.

## The `?` Operator

Boba provides the `?` operator as a convenient way to work with `Result` values. It simplifies error handling by propagating errors up the call stack.

This operator is powerful syntactic sugar for a `match` statement that handles the `Err` case for you. Here's how it works:

- If the `Result` is `Ok(value)`, the `?` operator unwraps the `Result` and gives you the `value` inside.
- If the `Result` is `Err(error)`, the `?` operator immediately stops the current function and returns the `Err(error)`.

Before the `?` operator was introduced, handling nested `Result` values required explicit `match` statements. For example, to get a value from a fallible operation and continue, you would write:

```boba
fn do_something() -> Result<string, error> {
    let result = might_fail() // This returns a Result

    let value = match result {
        Ok(v) => v, // Extract the value and continue
        Err(e) => return Err(e), // On failure, return immediately
    }

    // ... continue working with `value`
    return Ok(f"Success with {value}")
}
```

The `?` operator is a concise shorthand for that entire `match` block.

// A simple struct to hold our error information.
```boba
struct Error {
  message: string,
}
```

// A struct to hold our configuration data
```boba
struct Config {
  hostname: string,
  port: int,
  enable_https: boolean
}
```

The true power of the `?` operator becomes apparent when chaining multiple operations that can each fail, as it allows you to write a clean "happy path" while correctly propagating any error that occurs at any step.

The following function, `load_config`, is a great example of this. It will read a file and parse it as JSON. Both of these operations can fail, making them perfect candidates for using `Result` and the `?` operator.

```boba
fn load_config() -> Result<Config, Error> {
    // Assume `read_file` and `parse_json` are fallible functions
    // provided by Boba's standard library, imported from modules
    // like `boba::fs` and `boba::json`.
    var content = read_file("config.json")?
    var config = parse_json(content)?

    print("Config loaded!")

    return Ok(config)
}
```

### Time to Practice!

Now it's your turn. Look for opportunities in your own code to refactor functions to return a `Result`. Use the `?` operator to clean up your error handling and make your code more robust and readable.
