Enums, short for enumerations, are a way to define a custom type that has a fixed set of possible values. This is useful when you have a variable that can only be one of a few possible things.

## Defining an Enum

You define an enum using the `enum` keyword, followed by the name of the enum and a list of its possible values (called variants).

```boba
enum Color {
  RED,
  GREEN,
  BLUE
}
```

## Using an Enum

Once you have defined an enum, you can use it as a type for your variables. The variants are accessed through the enum type itself.

```boba
// The type of `myColor` is inferred as `Color`
var myColor = Color.GREEN

// You can use enums in comparisons
if (myColor == Color.GREEN) {
  print("The color is green!")
}
```

Enums are a powerful feature for making your code more expressive and safe. They become even more powerful when combined with the `match` statement, which we'll explore in the very next chapter.
