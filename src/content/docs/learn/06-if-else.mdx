In programming, you often need to execute different code depending on certain conditions. Boba uses the familiar `if`, `else if`, and `else` keywords to handle conditional logic.

## The `if` Statement

The `if` statement executes a block of code only if a specified condition is `true`.

```boba
var temperature: float = 30.0

if temperature > 25 {
  print("It's a hot day!")
}
```

## The `else` Statement

You can use the `else` statement to provide a block of code to execute if the `if` condition is `false`.

```boba
var score: int = 85

if score >= 60 {
  print("You passed!")
} else {
  print("You failed. Better luck next time!")
}
```

## The `else if` Statement

To handle multiple conditions, you can chain `if` statements with `else if`.

```boba
var hunger = "hungry"
var thirst = "thirsty"

if hunger == "hungry" and thirst == "thirsty" {
  print("You are hungry and thirsty.")
} else if hunger == "hungry" {
  print("You are only hungry.")
} else if thirst == "thirsty" {
  print("You are only thirsty.")
} else {
  print("You are neither hungry nor thirsty.")
}
```

### Concise Conditionals with One-Liner `if/else`

> For simple conditional assignments, you can use `if/else` as a one-line expression without curly braces. This is a clean and readable way to choose between two values.

```boba
let health: int = 75

// The entire if/else expression evaluates to a single value.
let status: string = if health > 50 { "Healthy" } else { "Injured" }

print(f"Player status: {status}") // Outputs: Player status: Healthy
```
This is similar to the ternary operator (`condition ? expr_if_true : expr_if_false`) found in languages like C++, Java, and JavaScript, but is designed for greater readability.
