## Guaranteed Cleanup with `defer`

The `defer` statement schedules a function call to be executed right before the current function exits, regardless of whether the function returns normally, propagates an error with the `?` operator, or exits due to a `panic`.

// Assume `fs` is Boba's file system module, providing functions
// that return a Result, like `fs.open(path)`.
// We also assume a defined `Error` struct (from the Result chapter).

```boba
pub fn process_file(path: string) -> Result<string, Error> {
    // 1. Open the file. If this fails, we exit, no cleanup needed.
    var file = fs.open(path)?

    // 2. Defer the close call *immediately* after opening.
    // This is now GUARANTEED to run when process_file exits.
    defer file.close()

    // 3. Now, we can focus on the logic without worrying about cleanup.
    var data = file.read_all()?
    if data.is_empty() {
        // We can just return. `defer file.close()` will run automatically.
        return Err({ message = "File is empty" })
    }

    // `defer file.close()` will also run automatically before this return.
    return Ok("Processed data!")
}

If a function has multiple `defer` statements, they are executed in **Last-In, First-Out (LIFO)** order. The last `defer` scheduled is the first one to run when the function exits. This is a crucial rule for correct resource management when multiple resources are acquired.

## Unrecoverable Errors with `panic`

Whereas `Result` is used for expected, recoverable errors, `panic` is reserved for unrecoverable errors that signify a bug in the program's logic. A panic is an abrupt, unrecoverable error that stops the normal execution of your program. `panic` must not be used for ordinary, expected errors like a file not being found or invalid user input; those are cases where `Result` is the appropriate tool.

When a panic occurs, the program will stop what it's doing and begin to **unwind the stack**. As it unwinds, it will execute any **`defer`** statements it finds along the way.

You can trigger a panic manually with the built-in `panic()` function.

```boba
fn get_guild_rank(player: Player) -> string {
  // This function assumes the player is in a guild.
  let rank_option = player.guild_rank() // Returns Option<string>

  match rank_option {
    Some(rank) => return rank,
    None => {
      // If we get here, it means another part of our code called this
      // function with a player who wasn't in a guild. This is a bug.
      panic(f"Critical error: get_guild_rank called on non-guild member {player.name}!")
    }
  }
}

### Time to Practice!

It's time to practice what you've learned. The next exercises will challenge you to refactor a function to use `defer` for resource cleanup and write a function that correctly panics when its input violates a critical precondition.
