In Boba, conditional logic is used not only to control which code runs (as a statement), but also to evaluate to a value (as an expression). This makes if/else a powerful tool for both program flow and variable assignment.

## The `if` Statement

The `if` statement executes a block of code only if a specified condition is `true`.

```boba
var temperature: float = 30.0

if temperature > 25 {
  print("It's a hot day!")
}
```

## The `else` Statement

You can use the `else` statement to provide a block of code to execute if the `if` condition is `false`.

```boba
var score: int = 85

if score >= 60 {
  print("You passed!")
} else {
  print("You failed. Better luck next time!")
}
```

## The `else if` Statement

To handle multiple conditions, you can chain `if` statements with `else if`.

```boba
var hunger = "hungry"
var thirst = "thirsty"

if hunger == "hungry" and thirst == "thirsty" {
  print("You are hungry and thirsty.")
} else if hunger == "hungry" {
  print("You are only hungry.")
} else if thirst == "thirsty" {
  print("You are only thirsty.")
} else {
  print("You are neither hungry nor thirsty.")
}
```

### Using if as an Expression

> For simple conditional assignments, you can use `if/else` as a one-line expression without curly braces. This is a clean and readable way to choose between two values.

```boba
let health: int = 75

// The entire if/else expression evaluates to a single value.
let status: string = if health > 50 { "Healthy" } else { "Injured" }

print(f"Player status: {status}") // Outputs: Player status: Healthy
```
This concept isn't limited to single lines. Full if/else blocks are also expressions, meaning they can evaluate to a value that can be returned or assigned. This allows for very clean and readable logic without temporary mutable variables.
```boba
let player_health = 75

    let armor_message: string = if player_health == 100 {
    print("Player is at full health.")
    "Wearing pristine, shining armor."
    } else if player_health > 50 {
    "Wearing battle-worn, dented armor."
    } else {
    "Wearing cracked and broken armor."
    }

    print(armor_message) // Outputs: Wearing battle-worn, dented armor.
```

Notice how the last line in each block becomes the value that the if expression returns.
