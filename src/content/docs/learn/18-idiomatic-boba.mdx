Welcome to the final step in your learning journey: moving from writing code that works to writing code that is truly idiomatic. Idiomatic code is clear, maintainable, and leverages the language's strengths in the way its designers intended.

## Naming Conventions

Consistent naming makes code predictable.

- **`PascalCase` for Types:** All `struct` and `enum` types.
  - `struct PlayerProfile`, `enum RequestStatus`
- **`snake_case` for Values:** All functions, methods, and variables.
  - `fn get_user_data`, `let current_score`, `var remaining_attempts`
- **`SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for Constants:** Global or module-level constants declared with `let`.
  - `let MAX_CONNECTIONS = 100`

## Formatting (`boba fmt`)

The `boba fmt` tool handles formatting automatically, ensuring all code in the ecosystem is instantly familiar.

## BobaDoc: The Standardized Documentation Engine

Good code is well-documented. Boba has a built-in standard for documentation called BobaDoc, which is designed to be easy to write, human-readable, and machine-parsable.

-   **`///` (Outer Comment):** Documents the single item immediately following it (function, struct, etc.). This is the primary doc comment type.
-   **`//!` (Inner Comment):** Documents the enclosing item. When used at the top of a file, it describes the entire module.

BobaDoc uses simple `@` tags for structured data:

-   `@param name: description` - Describes a parameter.
-   `@returns: description` - Describes the return value.
-   `@panics: description` - Describes conditions that will cause a panic.
-   `@example:` - Marks a following code block as an example.

```boba
//! A module for safe file system operations.

/// Reads an entire file into a string.
///
/// This function handles opening, reading, and closing the file. It is the
/// primary, safe way to get the contents of a file.
///
/// @param path: The string path to the file to be read.
/// @returns: A `Result` containing the file's contents as a `string` on success,
///          or an `error` if the file cannot be found or read.
/// @example:
///   var content = fs.read_file("my_file.txt")?
pub fn read_file(path: string) -> Result<string, error> {
    // ... implementation ...
}
```

## Comments vs. Documentation

- Use BobaDoc (`///`) to explain the *what* and *how* for users of your API. This is for the public interface.
- Use inline comments (`//`) to explain the *why* for maintainers of your code. Explain complex logic, non-obvious choices, or the reasoning behind a particular algorithm.
