This is the final step in your learning journey: moving from writing code that works to writing code that is truly idiomatic. Idiomatic code is clear, maintainable, and leverages the language's strengths as its designers intended.

Idiomatic code follows established patterns and conventions that make it immediately recognizable and understandable to other Boba developers. It's not just about syntax - it's about expressing intent clearly and efficiently.

## Naming Conventions

Consistent naming makes code predictable and easy to read. Boba follows established patterns that help you immediately understand what kind of entity you're looking at:

- **`PascalCase` for Types:** All `struct` and `enum` types.
  - `struct PlayerProfile`, `enum RequestStatus`
- **`snake_case` for Values:** All functions, methods, and variables.
  - `fn get_user_data`, `let current_score`, `var remaining_attempts`
- **`SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for Constants:** Global or module-level constants declared with `let`.
  - `let MAX_CONNECTIONS = 100`

## Formatting (`boba fmt`)

The `boba fmt` tool handles formatting automatically, ensuring all code in the ecosystem is instantly familiar. Having one official formatting tool eliminates style debates and reduces cognitive load when reading different projects.

Use `boba fmt` to format your code before committing. This ensures consistency across the entire Boba ecosystem and makes code reviews focus on logic rather than style.

## BobaDoc: The Standardized Documentation Engine

Good code is well-documented. Boba has a built-in documentation standard called BobaDoc that's easy to write, human-readable, and machine-parsable.

**`///` (Outer Comment)** documents the item immediately following it. **`//!` (Inner Comment)** documents the item that contains it, typically used at the top of files to document entire modules.

BobaDoc uses simple `@` tags for structured data:

-   `@param name: description` - Describes a parameter.
-   `@returns: description` - Describes the return value.
-   `@panics: description` - Describes conditions that will cause a panic.
-   `@example:` - Marks a following code block as an example.

Code within `@example` blocks can be automatically tested with `boba test --doc`, ensuring documentation stays accurate as your code evolves.

```boba
//! A module for safe file system operations.

/// Reads an entire file into a string.
///
/// This function handles opening, reading, and closing the file. It is the
/// primary, safe way to get the contents of a file.
///
/// @param path: The string path to the file to be read.
/// @returns: A `Result` containing the file's contents as a `string` on success,
///          or an `Error` if the file cannot be found or read.
/// @example:
///   var content = read_file("my_file.txt")?
pub fn read_file(path: string) -> Result<string, Error> {
    // ... implementation ...
}
```

## Comments vs. Documentation

**Use BobaDoc (`///`)** to explain the *what* and *how* for users of your API - focus on the public interface. **Use inline comments (`//`)** to explain the *why* for maintainers - complex logic, non-obvious choices, or reasoning behind algorithms.

Good documentation helps users understand how to use your code, while good comments help future developers (including yourself) understand why you wrote it that way.

## Time to Practice!

Apply idiomatic Boba principles to your code:

1. **Follow naming conventions**: Use PascalCase for types, snake_case for values
2. **Format consistently**: Run `boba fmt` on all your code
3. **Write clear documentation**: Use BobaDoc for public APIs
4. **Add helpful comments**: Explain complex logic and design decisions
5. **Test your examples**: Use `boba test --doc` to verify documentation

## What's Next?

Congratulations on completing this foundational tour of the Boba language! You've progressed from writing your first "Hello, world!" to understanding the principles of idiomatic, professional Boba code.

You've mastered core concepts including variables, control flow, functions, and custom types. More importantly, you've learned features that make Boba robust and safe: `Option` and `Result` for explicit error handling, pattern matching for exhaustive control flow, and the built-in testing framework.

**Continue growing as a Boba developer:**
- **Explore the Standard Library** - Familiarize yourself with available tools and modules
- **Build complete projects** - Apply your knowledge to command-line tools or web servers  
- **Read idiomatic Boba code** - Learn from experienced developers' patterns and practices

You now have the foundation to build reliable, maintainable software with Boba. Welcome to the community!
