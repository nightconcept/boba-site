Boba's primary tool for control flow is the powerful `match` statement. It allows you to check a value against a series of patterns in a clean and expressive way. Its key strength is that the compiler enforces **exhaustiveness**, which is why it is the perfect tool for safely working with enum types like `Option` and `Result`.

### The Rule of Exhaustiveness

A `match` statement in Boba must be **exhaustive**. This means you must provide a branch for every possible value the type can have. The Boba compiler will give you an error if you forget a case, preventing a whole class of bugs.

The `match` statement is most powerful when used with types that have a fixed number of variations, like `Option` and `Result`.

```boba
// Safely unwrapping an Option
match find_user(1) {
    Some(name) => print(f"Found user: {name}"),
    None => print("User not found.")
}
```

`match` works just as effectively on the `Result` type. Here's how you can handle a function that might return an error:

```boba
fn read_config_file() -> Result<string, error> {
    // This function might return Ok("file content") or Err({message: "..."})
    // ...
}

match read_config_file() {
    Ok(content) => print(f"Config file content: {content}"),
    Err(err) => print(f"Failed to read config: {err.message}")
}
```

### Binding Values from Patterns

The real power of match is its ability to deconstruct a type and bind the values inside its variants to new variables. In a branch like Some(name) => ..., a new variable name is created and is only available within that specific branch. This allows you to check for a variant and use its inner value in a single, clean operation.

```boba
match find_user(1) {
    // The `user_name` variable is created here and holds the string from inside `Some`.
    Some(user_name) => print(f"The user's name is {user_name}."),
    None => print("No user was found.")
}
```

### Conditional Guards with where

Sometimes, a pattern alone isn't specific enough. You can add a conditional guard to a match arm using the where keyword. The branch will only be taken if both the pattern matches and the where condition evaluates to true. This allows for more complex logic within your match statements.

```boba
// Multi-line match statement example
fn get_player_status(health: Option<int>) -> string {
  // The match statement itself is an expression, so its result
  // can be directly returned or assigned.
  match health {
    Some(h) if h == 100 => {
      return "Player is at full health."
    },

    Some(h) if h > 50 => {
      let message = f"Player is doing okay with {h} health."
      return message
    },
    Some(h) => {
      return f"Player is in critical condition with only {h} health!"
    },
    None => {
      return "Player status is unknown or offline."
    },
  }
}

// Single-line match statement example
struct Error {
  code: int,
}

match response {
  Ok(data) => print(f"Success! Received data: {data}"),
  Err(e) if e.code == 404 => print("Error: Not Found."),
  Err(_) => print("An unknown error occurred."), // Using '_' as a catch-all
}
```

While `_` is necessary for matching on types with a near-infinite number of values (like `int` or `string`), it should be used cautiously with enums. Using it can sometimes bypass the compiler's exhaustiveness check. For example, if a new variant is added to an enum later, the wildcard `_` will catch it silently instead of causing a helpful compile error that would force you to handle the new case explicitly. This is why, for enums like `Option` and `Result`, it's best to match each variant explicitly whenever possible.

This exhaustiveness is not just a conventionâ€”it's a guarantee. If you write a `match` statement for an `Option` and forget to handle the `None` case, your code will not compile. The compiler ensures you have considered both the `Some` and `None` cases, or the `Ok` and `Err` cases, before your program can run.

### The Default Case: `_`

Sometimes, you don't want to handle every single case explicitly. For these situations, you can use the wildcard pattern, a single underscore (`_`), as a default or "catch-all" branch. The `_` will match any value that hasn't been matched by the preceding branches.

This is useful when matching on types with many possibilities, like numbers or strings.

```boba
var status_code: int = 418

match status_code {
    200 => print("OK"),
    404 => print("Not Found"),
    // The `_` handles every other possible integer value.
    _ => print("An unexpected error occurred.")
}
```

#### **Time to Practice!**

The final set of exercises will challenge you to solve problems by writing `match` statements that handle both `Option` and `Result` types, reinforcing the learning from the last three chapters.
