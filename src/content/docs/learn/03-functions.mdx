Functions are blocks of code that you can name and call from other parts of your program. They are essential for organizing your code and making it reusable.

## Defining and Calling Functions

You define a function using the `fn` keyword. You can also specify the types of the arguments and the return value.

```boba
// A simple function that takes no arguments and returns nothing.
fn say_hello() {
  print("Hello, Boba!")
}

// Call the function
say_hello()
```

### Function Calls: Mandatory Named Arguments

A common source of subtle bugs in many languages occurs when arguments are passed to a function in the wrong order. For example, a function call like `create_user("Admin", 123)` might silently succeed when the function actually expected `(id: int, role: string)`. Boba solves this problem by requiring named arguments by default.

To maximize clarity, Boba requires function arguments to be called with their names by default. This makes function call sites self-documenting. This approach is built into the language to achieve the clarity that developers in other languages like JavaScript or Python often simulate by passing a single 'options' object to a function.

### The Default: Named Arguments

All arguments at a function call site _must_ be called with their name, using a colon (`:`) as a separator.

```boba
// This function requires named arguments.
pub fn connect(host: string, port: int, timeout: int) { /* ... */ }

// Correct call:
connect(host: "boba.dev", port: 9000, timeout: 5000)

// COMPILE ERROR: Positional arguments not allowed for this function.
// connect("boba.dev", 9000, 5000)
```

### Opting-In to Positional Arguments

For a parameter to be callable positionally, its name in the function _declaration_ must be prefixed with an underscore (`_`). The function's author uses this to signal that the argument's order is natural and unambiguous, like the operands in an addition function.

```boba
// This function allows positional arguments.
pub fn add(_ a: int, _ b: int) -> int { return a + b }

// Correct calls:
add(5, 3)
add(a: 5, b: 3) // Named calls are still allowed for clarity.
```

### Mixing Named and Positional Arguments

If a function has both positional and named arguments, all positional arguments must come first.

```boba
// This function mixes positional and named arguments.
pub fn create_user(_ id: int, name: string, is_admin: boolean) { /* ... */ }

// Correct call: Positional arguments first.
create_user(101, name: "Ada", is_admin: false)

// COMPILE ERROR: Positional argument cannot follow a named argument.
// create_user(name: "Ada", 101, is_admin: false)
```

### Chaining Functions with the Pipe Operator

Boba includes a special pipe operator (`|>`) to make chaining function calls more readable. It takes the result of the expression on its left and passes it as the first argument to the function on its right.

This operator is purely for developer ergonomics. It transforms deeply nested calls that must be read "from the inside-out" into a linear sequence of steps that can be read "from left-to-right," which more closely matches how we think about a data transformation pipeline.

Consider a set of functions to process text:

```boba
fn trim(s: string) -> string { /* ... */ }
fn to_uppercase(s: string) -> string { /* ... */ }
fn emphasize(s: string) -> string { f"**{s}**" }
```

Without the pipe operator, processing a message requires nesting the calls, which is read from the inside out and can be hard to follow:

```boba
let message = "  hello world  "
let formatted = emphasize(to_uppercase(trim(message)))
// formatted is "**HELLO WORLD**"
```

With the pipe operator, you can express the same logic as a clear, left-to-right sequence of transformations:

```boba
let message = "  hello world  "
let formatted = message |> trim() |> to_uppercase() |> emphasize()
// formatted is "**HELLO WORLD**"
```

This style is a cornerstone of functional programming and is highly encouraged in Boba for creating readable data processing pipelines.
