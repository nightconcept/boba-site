Functions are blocks of code that you can name and call from other parts of your program. They are essential for organizing your code and making it reusable.

## Defining and Calling Functions

You define a function using the `fn` keyword. You can also specify the types of the arguments and the return value.

```boba
// A simple function that takes no arguments and returns nothing.
fn say_hello() {
  print("Hello, Boba!")
}

// Call the function
say_hello()
```

### Functions with Return Values
To have a function return a value, you must declare its type after an arrow (`->`). Inside the function, you use the `return` keyword to send the value back to the code that called it.

```boba
fn get_greeting(name: string) -> string {
  return f"Hello, {name}!"
}

let message = get_greeting("Boba")
print(message) // Outputs: Hello, Boba!
```

## Function Calls: Mandatory Named Arguments

A common source of subtle bugs in many languages occurs when arguments are passed to a function in the wrong order. For example, a function call like `create_user("Admin", 123)` might silently succeed when the function actually expected `(id: int, role: string)`. Boba solves this problem by requiring named arguments by default. This makes function call sites self-documenting.

In Boba, all arguments at a function call site with more than one argument _must_ be called with their name, using a colon (`:`) as a separator.

```boba
// This function requires named arguments.
pub fn connect(host: string, port: int, timeout: int) { /* ... */ }

// Correct call:
connect(host: "boba.dev", port: 9000, timeout: 5000)

// COMPILE ERROR: Positional arguments not allowed for this function.
// connect("boba.dev", 9000, 5000)


// From the previous example, these are all allowed:
say_hello()
print("Hello, Boba!")
get_greeting(name: "Boba")
```

## Controlling Visibility: Public vs. Private Functions

Now that you know how to define a function, it's important to understand who can call it. Boba is designed for safety and clear organization, so it has a simple rule: by default, everything you create is private.

When a function is private, it means it can only be seen and used by code within the very same file where it is defined. It is completely invisible to the outside world. This is a powerful feature that lets you write internal helper functions without worrying that they will be used incorrectly by other parts of a large program.

To make a function part of a file's public API so that it can be used by other files, you must explicitly mark it as public using the pub keyword at the beginning of its definition.

You can think of it like building a house:
- A private function (the default) is like a bedroom or a utility closet—it's essential for the house to work, but it's only meant to be used by the people living inside.
- A public function (marked with pub) is like the front door or the mailbox—it's the official, designated way for guests and visitors to interact with the house from the outside.

You may have noticed the pub keyword in some of the previous examples. This new understanding explains why it was there: those functions were being designed as public, reusable tools. This concept of public versus private will apply to other things you create later, such as structs and enums.

## Default Parameters
You can make function arguments optional by providing a default value. This is done by adding `= value` after the parameter's type. If the argument is omitted in the function call, the default value is used.

```boba
fn connect(host: string, port: int = 8080, use_tls: boolean = true) {
  print(f"Connecting to {host}:{port} (TLS: {use_tls})")
}

connect(host: "boba.dev") // Uses default port and TLS setting
connect(host: "boba.dev", port: 9000) // Overrides port, uses default TLS
```

## Closures: Anonymous Functions

Besides defining named functions with fn, Boba also allows you to create closures, which are lightweight, anonymous functions you can define on the fly. Closures are powerful because you can store them in variables and pass them as arguments to other functions.

You define a closure using vertical bars | for the parameters, followed by an expression.

```boba
// A closure that takes two integers and adds them.
let add = |a: int, b: int| a + b

// You can call the closure just like a regular function.
let sum = add(2, 3)
print(sum) // Outputs: 5
```

This ability to treat functions as data is a cornerstone of functional programming. While it may seem simple, it unlocks incredibly expressive patterns, especially when working with lists and other collections, as you'll see in later chapters.

## Chaining Functions with the Pipe Operator

Boba includes a special pipe operator (`|>`) to make chaining function calls more readable. This operator is purely for developer ergonomics. It transforms deeply nested calls that must be read "from the inside-out" into a linear sequence of steps that can be read "from left-to-right."

To maintain clarity with the named-argument system, the pipe operator uses a placeholder token, #, to explicitly mark where the piped value should be inserted in the next function call. In cases where is only one argument, the pipe operator can be used without the placeholder token.

Consider a set of functions to process text:

```boba
fn trim(s: string) -> string { /* ... */ }
fn to_uppercase(s: string) -> string { /* ... */ }
fn emphasize(text: string) -> string { f"**{text}**" }
fn send_email(to: string, subject: string, body: string) { /* ... */ }
```

Without the pipe operator, processing a message requires nesting the calls:


```boba
let message = "  hello world  "
let formatted = send_email(to: "bob@boba-lang.org", subject: "Hello", body: emphasize(text: to_uppercase(s: trim(s: message))))
// formatted is "**HELLO WORLD**"
```

With the Hack-style pipe operator, you can express the same logic as a clear, left-to-right sequence of transformations, telling the pipe exactly which argument to use:

```boba
let message = "  hello world  "
let formatted = message
    |> trim(s: #)
    |> to_uppercase(s: #)
    |> emphasize(text: #)
    |> send_email(to: "bob@boba-lang.org", subject: "Hello", body: #)

// This is equivalent to the above, but without the placeholder token for single argument functions.
let formatted_no_placeholder = message
    |> trim()
    |> to_uppercase()
    |> emphasize()
    |> send_email(to: "bob@boba-lang.org", subject: "Hello", body: #)

// formatted and formatted_no_placeholder are both "**HELLO WORLD**"
```

This style is a cornerstone of modern functional programming and is highly encouraged in Boba for creating readable and unambiguous data processing pipelines.
