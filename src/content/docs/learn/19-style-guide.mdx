description: "Learn the official Boba code style for writing clean, consistent, and readable code across the ecosystem."

A single, consistent code style is a cornerstone of the Boba ecosystem. It eliminates debates over formatting and makes all Boba code instantly familiar, which significantly improves readability and maintainability.

The official tool, `boba-fmt`, automatically formats your code to match these rules.

## The `boba-fmt` v1.0 Ruleset

### Naming Conventions

-   **`PascalCase`** for all types (`class`, `struct`, `enum`).
-   **`snake_case`** for all values (functions, methods, variables).
-   **`SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`** for compile-time `const` declarations.

### Formatting

-   **Indentation:** 2 spaces.
-   **Braces:** Opening brace (`{`) on the same line as the declaration (e.g., `fn my_func() {`).
-   **Line Length:** A soft limit of 100 characters. `boba-fmt` will try to adhere to this, but may exceed it for readability.

### Documentation

-   All `pub` items (functions, classes, structs, etc.) should have BobaDoc comments. This is a strong convention that makes your public APIs easy to understand and use.

## Example of "Perfect" Boba Code

Here is a small example that follows all the `boba-fmt` style rules.

```boba
//! A module for managing player data.

const DEFAULT_HEALTH: int = 100

/// Represents a player in the game.
struct Player {
  name: string,
  score: int,
}

/// Creates a new player with a default score.
/// @param name: The name for the new player.
/// @returns: A new `Player` struct.
pub fn new_player(name: string) -> Player {
  return Player{
    name: name,
    score: 0,
  }
}
```

**Congratulations!** You have completed the Boba language tutorial. You've learned about variables, data types, control flow, functions, and how to structure your code. You now have a solid foundation in the core concepts of the language.

The journey doesn't end here. The next logical step is to explore the guides on how to configure your project and use the Boba tooling effectively. Happy coding!
