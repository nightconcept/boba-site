import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

In many programming languages, the absence of a value is represented by `null`. While seemingly convenient, `null` is often called the "billion-dollar mistake" because it can lead to unexpected runtime errors...

To prevent this entire category of errors, Boba was designed without `null`. Instead, it provides a robust, built-in enum called `Option<T>` to handle values that might be absent.

## The `Option<T>` Enum

The `Option<T>` enum is defined as follows:

```boba
enum Option<T> {
    Some(T), // Represents the presence of a value of type T
    None,    // Represents the absence of a value
}
```

-   `Some(T)`: A variant that holds a value of type `T`.
-   `None`: A variant that represents the absence of a value. It is similar to `null` but is type-safe.

By using `Option<T>`, the possibility of an absent value becomes part of the type system. The compiler forces you to acknowledge and handle the `None` case, preventing null reference errors before they happen.

A common way to handle an `Option` is to use a `match` statement to provide a default value in the `None` case.

```boba
let timeout_option: Option<int> = user_settings.get("timeout")

let timeout: int = match timeout_option {
    Some(value) => value,
    None => 5000, // Default to 5000ms
}
```

## Shortcut: Unwrapping with a Default using ??

The `??` operator is a clean shorthand specifically for the common pattern of unwrapping a `Some` value or providing a default value if it's `None`.

```boba
// If the left side is Some(t), use t. If it's None, use the right side.
let value = config_map.get("timeout") ?? 5000
```

This operator makes your code cleaner by removing the boilerplate of a match statement for the simple "use this or a default" pattern.

## When to Use Option vs. Result

Both `Option` and `Result` deal with the possibility of a value not being what you expect, so when do you use which? The guideline can be framed as a question the developer should ask themselves.

*   For **`Option<T>`**, the question is: **"Is it normal and expected for a value to be absent here?"**
    *   `find_user_by_id()`: A user might not exist. This isn't an error; "user not found" is an expected, valid outcome of a search.
    *   `map.get(key)`: A key may not be in a map. This is normal.
    *   Getting the first element of a list: This could be `None` if the list is empty, which is a normal state.

*   For **`Result<T, E>`**, the question is: **"Is this an operation that is supposed to succeed, but could plausibly fail due to circumstances beyond my control?"**
    *   `fs.read_file()`: You expect to read a file, but it might fail due to permissions or the disk being full. A disk being full is an external failure, not an expected outcome of reading a file.
    *   `json.parse()`: You expect to parse a string, but it might fail because the string is malformed.
    *   Parsing a string into a number: This should succeed but could return an `Err` if the string is malformed (an operational failure).

<Aside>
A Note on Fallible Operations: String Indexing

In Boba, you can access individual characters of a string using index notation, like `my_string[0]`. However, this operation is fallible: if you try to access an index that is out of bounds (for example, indexing into an empty string), your program will panic. This is a perfect example of a situation where a function should return an `Option` to handle the "empty" case safely instead of panicking.

#### Time to Practice!

Now it's time to put `Option` to work. The next exercises will challenge you to write functions that return an `Option` and then use `match` to safely handle both the `Some` and `None` cases.
