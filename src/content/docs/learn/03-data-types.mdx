In the last chapter, you learned how to create variables and constants. Now, let's explore the fundamental data types you'll use to store different kinds of information in Boba.

## Primitive Types

Boba has a set of primitive types that are the building blocks of data in your programs.

### `int`

The `int` type is used to represent a 64-bit signed integer (a whole number). It is the ideal type for counting, indexing into collections, representing IDs, and any situation where fractional values are not needed.
```boba
let score: int = 100
let quantity: int = 3
let current_level = 10 // Inferred as int
```

### `float`

The `float` type is used to represent a 64-bit double-precision floating-point number. It is the correct type for scientific calculations, measurements, or any value that may have a fractional component.
```boba
let price: float = 19.99
const PI: float = 3.14159
var temperature = 25.5 // Inferred as float
```
Note: While floats are powerful, be mindful of standard precision limitations inherent to floating-point arithmetic.

### `string`

The `string` type is used to represent text.

```boba
var message: string = "Hello, Boba!"
var playerName = "Ada" // Inferred as a string
```

### `boolean`

The `boolean` type represents a value that can be either `true` or `false`. Booleans are essential for controlling the flow of your program.

```boba
var isGameOver: boolean = false
var hasKey = true // Inferred as a boolean
```

## Composite Types

Boba also has composite types, which are made up of primitive types.

### `list`

A `list` is an ordered collection of values of the same type. Lists are dynamic, meaning you can add or remove items.

```boba
// A list of numbers
var highScores: int[] = [100, 95, 80]

// A list of strings
var ingredients: string[] = ["flour", "sugar", "boba pearls"]
```

You can perform many operations on lists, like getting their size or adding new items.

```boba
print(ingredients.len()) // Outputs: 3

// Add a new item to the end
ingredients.push("tapioca pearls")
print(ingredients.len()) // Outputs: 4

// Access items by their index (starting from 0)
print(ingredients[0]) // Outputs: "flour"
```

### `map`

A `map` is a collection of key-value pairs. Each key must be unique, and all keys must be of the same type, as must all values.

```boba
// Create a map with string keys and number values
var scores: [string:int] = {
  "ada": 100,
  "grace": 95
}

// Check its initial size
print(scores.len()) // Outputs: 2

// Insert a new key-value pair
scores["boba"] = 105

// Check the new size
print(scores.len()) // Outputs: 3
```

Accessing a key in a map returns a special `Option` type to safely handle cases where the key might not exist. We will cover this powerful feature in a later chapter.

In the next chapter, we'll look at how to use these types with operators to perform calculations and make comparisons.
